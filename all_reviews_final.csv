Aegean Airlines,1/10,  This flight was cancelled by Aegean and I am still waiting for my refund.  Where is my money?,no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  Very disappointing, hand baggage is only one piece of 7 kg and no personal item. Aegean Airlines charged me 50 eur for an excess 2kg of hand baggage, totally unacceptable",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Trouble - free and polite check in at Terminal 2. Boarded efficiently. On time departure. Polite and professional crew, greeted at door. Box meal during flight but understandable given Covid precautions. Crew ensured face coverings were worn. Landed early and swift collection of luggage. A very professional and comfortable flight. Well done Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Heraklion to Thessaloniki with Aegean Airlines. Awful experience, very rude crew and they charge extra for luggage while you only can have one luggage of 8 kilos without informing you about changes before the check in.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  I was traveling to Bucharest, after checking in and going through the control area, I arrived at the gate that my flight was going to take place.  30 minutes before the flight, they announced that the boarding will start soon. Firstly, it was smooth no problems with anyone even though some people had more than 1 luggage, duty free bags. Towards the end of boarding and approximately 20 people were standing at the queue, a female came to check the last people's tickets to see what ticket they purchased. I have purchased the economy class ticket along with most of my fellows. That lady checked my ticket, and said only one bag is allowed in the plane looking at my other hand while I was holding an extra duty free bag with 2 bottle of spirit that I purchased. And she literally pointed that I had to shove into my bag 2 alcoholic spirits which it was really hard since my bag was smaller than the required size.  I did manage to storeboth in my bag which I was really glad about it. When I reached the ticket check, the same lady stopped me and said ""OK did u manage to fit everything in your luggage'' I replied ""yes thank you"" and she goes ""ok let's check the weight"". It's this moment that you realize the obvious. Yes the luggage was more than 8kg but what you expect after she is the one that told me fit everything in your bag so you can board the aircraft. So I was really angry at that moment and that is why I started yelling. What was the outcome?! I did manage to fit the 2 alcoholic spirits in my bag I had only one bag That bag was more that 8 kg obviously since I had to fit everything She initially said nothing can be done and after a while she changed her mind and charged that bag with an extra 50 euros. ",no
Aegean Airlines,7/10," 6-month old Airbus A320 Neo. Aegean has opted for a very nice internal configuration on this brand new aircraft type but, strangely, without IFE & overhead screens for live flight tracking / map. Smiling and helpful crew. Poor mean served (a small sandwich, a small chocolate bar and a bottle of water). Full drinks service. At the moment, the Aegean lounge at Athens airport has a much better offering than the Lufthansa lounge. Would fly again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  I required assistance on flights from Edinburgh via Athens to Santorini, and on my return , I would like to thank all of your staff at every stage of my journey, they were excellent on every level and made my journey so easy and were pleasant and made me feel comfortable, thank you all so much",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10," Check-in in Dublin was handled by Swissport, the staff were friendly and efficient. The Swissport staff apologised that the lounge was not available (not sure if this was Covid-19 related or because the flight departs at 23.59), in any case Aegean should really make this clear at the time of booking. Fast Track security was also closed but it didn't matter as there was hardly anyone at security. Boarding was well managed. The cabin was modern and comfortable and USB ports were available at the seat. The Cabin Crew were charming and efficient. The on board service consisted of a bag containing a sandwich, a muffin, juice and water. There was also a bar service with alcoholic and soft drinks. I had pre-ordered a gluten free meal but all special meals have been suspended due to Covid-19. While I understand the need to simplify the service I think it should still be possible to provide special meals in a pre-packaged format like the standard meals. My only other observation is that the cabin crew could have been more strict enforcing face covering requirements where passengers were wearing these below the nose/mouth. Although I had booked a flexible business class fare there was still a substantial fare difference to change my return flight date.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  I cannot speak for the flight itself but for the boarding experience at Malpensa Airport. Boarding staff were verbally aggressive towards me. I hadn't the PLF form to fly to Greece but managed to submit it while waiting fellow passengers boarding, the flight was due to arrive at 9 pm and I would receive the PLF at 0 am the next day so I could easily waited that time at Athens airport to present it to authorities, still the boarding gate lady, which spoke fluent Portuguese and was Portuguese, refused me boarding.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  The A320neo has 31 rows of seats which means the legroom is very tight. During e-check in they allocate you seat which you cannot change unless you pay at least €5. Inflight service was poor with a bag which contained a sandwich, a snack and a bottle of water. They do not serve alcohol due to covid-19. Announcements were on English and Greek. ",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  I had two calls with them on the 23rd and the 24th of July with regards to changing my flight. According to them, I could have one change without penalty with no extra charge due to Covid-19. However, because I needed to change airports, I had to pay the penalty. Whilst on my first call, the girl I talked to told me that I needed to pay 100euros for the change whereas the next day I was told to pay 140euros for the same change (Note: The flight rate didn't change at all). Despite the difference, I changed my flight ticket asking for a baggage too. They booked my ticket without adding a baggage! I called yesterday to ask what happened and they were telling me that there was no charge for the baggage. Then, they told me they would listen to my recording and call me back. They called me two hours later; the phone was ringing for 5 secs and I did not manage to pick it up. I called back and I was told that the girl who was assisting me finished her work for the day. The next person told me that would look into it but instead of putting me on hold, they hung up on me and never called back! I called again today, the assistant could not find the notes of the first person who listened to the recording and of course did not add my baggage for free. I did however requested both calls (the one asking for 100euros and the second one when they asked for more money and did not add my baggage); I am waiting for the response. On the 2nd of August, I flew from Athens to Heraklion. There was about a 2-hour delay and the airline offered us a free ticket. However, they state that I cannot use the free ticket during Christmas, Easter, July and August but as I live in the UK and I am not allowed to use it the only periods that I can travel to Greece. Due to Covid-19 they do not allow a backpack and a cabin bag on board. They do not allow to check-in the cabin bag. The price tickets are not cheaper either. ",no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Up until recently Aegean was one of the best carriers in Europe. This is not the case anymore as they are adopting more and more policies of a typical low cost airline. For the lowest fare category (go light), one item is now allowed in the cabin and seat selection is not free. Any extra item cannot be checked for free but customers need to pay a fee at the airport. I just hope this is a temporary measure due to Covid19.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Flying from Rhodes to Larnaca with my family during the Covid-19 pandemic with Aegean Airlines was not a nice experience. The passengers behind us kept taking their masks off and talking, and despite our numerous attempt to ask the staff to ask the passengers to keep their masks on they took it off. Even a steward talked to them for 15 minutes while it was off and still they did not care. We ended up having to keep it on for everyones safety and they just said relax.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Heraklion to Thessaloniki. They said that because of covid-19 we could only bring one item on board. People had to measure their luggage size and to pay 40 euros extra, while there was plenty of space on board. At the same time there were really no airport covid19 tests taking place.  Also my seat was small for 75 mins flight. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Barcelona to Athens. I'll have to start with the fact that they let you have a checked in bag which weighs up to a certain amount of kilos for free, which as far as I'm concerned is not the case for many airlines. Flight was initially delayed by half an hour or so which for me wasn't a lot as I didn't have any connecting flights to worry about, but I understand that for some people this might not be the case. Boarding was done via jetbridge and was rather fast considering the flight was full. We boarded the plane, but didn't take off for nearly another two hours due to a thunderstorm over the airport. The seats were very comfortable for Economy class, but again I'm only 1.62 so my opinion on this probably isn't relevant. The pilots made an announcement straight away and the flight attendants handed out free drinks to everyone during the time we spent on the ground. The pilots kept informing us of the situation and when we finally took off the flight was extremely turbulent, but they handled the situation pretty well I must say. A free hot meal was provided for all passengers, both Bussiness and Economy class which is very rare these days for an intra-european flight. When we arrived in Athens the pilots made an apology for the delay and announced that every passenger who had missed their connecting flight would be offered either a free rebooking or a voucher but I can't remember exactly, as I didn't need one. Luggage came out quickly and it wasn't damaged in any way. The price was ok but considering their excellent service I can't even think about complaining about the price. The only thing that I didn't quite like was the fact that there was no in flight entertaining as there were no screens which having flown on their A320s as well I know are present there, but not in the A321, but again, I'm not complaining. Fantastic experience and I would totally recommend this airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Aegean is my favorite Greek Airline. In July 2019 I travelled from Munich to Athens. Aegean aircraft was perfect also seat was perfect. Landed on time at Athens Airport with smooth landing.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Corfu to Athens in September 2019. Used Aegean several times. Definitely one of the best European airlines. Seat comfort, service, cleanliness, even food is superior to most airlines. Had an issue once when a ferry was cancelled and we couldn’t catch our flight. Aegean immediately exchanged our tickets at no extra cost.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  It was the best air trip. Aegean Airlines occured a flight from Brussels to Athens without any cancellation in addition to other airlines. (During the period of covid 19). The crew was gentle and ready to make us feel comfortable. The second trip that i did from Athens to Rhodes surprised me a lot, as it occurred with three only passengers. Me and two other passengers, it makes me extremely impression. I really appreciate Aegean customer service and policy and i hope to make another air trip with this airline soon.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,  Aegean canceled our flight on 30th March because it stopped all flights to Athens from 26th March onwards. They refused to refund us because our tickets were not refundable. We filed a complaint asking for a refund since it was the Airline that canceled the flight and not us. They offered a credit voucher that can be used within the next 18 months. ,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Heraklion to Athens. I finally found a flight to get home to the UK during the Corona virus crisis, flying Aegean to Athens and then Swiss Air to the UK via Zurich. It was a difficult time and travelling was quite stressful given the situation. We travelled with hand luggage to avoid baggage claim. When my wife and I came to board in Heraklion the ground staff,  weighed our bags and asked for a credit card and charged us 80 euros for excess baggage. We would have expected more compassion. Swiss offered to put the bags in the hold for not cost and could not have been more sympathetic and accommodating during the crisis. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Last minute trip to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Received text advising flight cancelation, was re-booked on evening flight without any additional charge. Helpful and sympathetic staff. Inflight service as polite and professional as always. Thanks Aegean for a great job in difficult circumstance. Other airlines, take note.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10," London to Athens. Aegean is anything but an airline! They simply should not exist! Business Class ticket and from London to Athens, the back of my seat was destroyed. While in Athens, they cancel the flight and then they ask me to pay more to rebook my flight! When I ask the agent to transfer the call to a supervisor, his response was “it is the airline’s policy not to allow the passenger to speak with supervisors”! Simply unacceptable! There is absolutely no reason for companies like this one to exist!",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10," I booked a flight from Athens to Thessaloniki return. They cancelled the flights and never gave back the refund of the amount and they suggested either rebooking (with the fare difference paid by me) or a credit voucher with limitations, valid for 12 months. I said to them I want a full refund of my ticket and I disagree with these 2 options as I am not obliged to fly with them next time. They said that their regulations changed because of COVID-19 and they don't refund. I feel like someone stole my money. I still wait for a refund because they violated the rules of the ticket issued. For sure, the airline's policy shows how they threat passengers both aboard and on the ground in any situation.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  I bought and paid flex ticket Zurich to Corfu for late April, they cancelled the flight, no reimbursement, you have to phone to Athens but you never get through! No possibility by email, chat or online. They write that there are long waiting times for telephone connection but they don't solve this problem. ",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  Heraklion to Athens. Ground staff were rude to me. My bag was just over 9 kilos and I had to pay 40 Euros on the spot for a 30 minute internal flight. I paid and I asked if I can now at least take my bag on board.(My bag was within the required dimensions. I was told no, I can't take it onboard because it is more than 8 kilos.  Aegean has managed to build a great reputation over the last decades. Is it really worth damaging it for the sake of couple extra Euros which people pay when they are left with no choice? I will be avoiding Aegean wherever possible moving forward. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,  Athens to Frankfurt. The cabin crew are very welcoming and professional. This company offers a quality service clearly above the European average. It’s always a pleasure to fly with it.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Athens to Zurich. A320 neo, space between the seats in economy class is a no-go. Never encountered such an uncomfortable flight. A320s don’t get much denser than that and that is what my knees felt. They also put in place reclining seats, so this nightmare even gets worse if the person in front reclines. ",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Thessaloniki to Berlin via Athens. This was one of my best flights with Aegean. Second time to enjoy the service from a great purser. Always smiling and very professional. Perfect!,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Thessaloniki to Zurich via Athens with Aegean Airlines. Delayed departure due to technical problems and changing aircraft after boarding in Athens, from Zurich there was a delay due to delay of previous arrival due to strong winds. The inflight entertainment was boring. Crew were ok. All the meals were in a lot of plastic.",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,  Thessaloniki to Munich with Aegean Airlines. Full flight and not enough space for the bag under the seat in front. Since the boarding ground staff are measuring the hand luggage that needs to be a max of 8kg. If the weight is more than 8kg people had to pay 50€ at the gate. Some crew on board seem like they had more fun talking between each other and forgetting to give us a second drink. I was expecting much nicer service regarding the beverages.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Amsterdam to Athens. Enjoyable flight. Seamless check in at Schiphol Airport. Cabin immaculate, and crew well groomed. So nice to see air hostesses helping staff with storage in overhead lockers. Few European airlines still offer hot meals on flights throughout Europe. Moreover drinks and tea /coffee also all provided with no charge. No complaints. On arrival at Athens airport luggage came out swiftly. Well done Aegean!",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10," Frankfurt to Athens. Ground staff in Athens always rude and this is the reason I’m writing this review! It’s a shame as they apparently did not realize that it’s all about customer experience when you are working in the services sector! The airline itself it’s quite decent - even though a lot of the times there are flight delays, unfortunately, and the staff on board are usually very nice and welcoming, which makes their ground colleagues appear even ruder! And it makes you wonder: doesn’t the company have certain policies or training about customer service for all their employees?",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10," I flew with Aegean Airlines from Prague to Athens. The ground service wasn't the best . My flight was during the Christmas period and the flight was almost full. There were long queues in front of the desk of the airline company and the assistants seemed unable to handle the big number of passengers. The experience on-board was overall good. Comparing to other airlines the meal and the beverages were better and the flight attendants were kind and with a helpful attitude. The seats weren't the most convenient ones though. I paid for an extra 23 kg luggage for my flight. I was supposed to get it, after my arrival in Athens, but for some reason my suitcase was left in Prague. I reported the incident to the company, which is responsible for the tracking and management of lost baggages and luckily they found and delivered it to me the next evening. In my suitcase there were clothing and stuff that I needed. So, I decided to contact the costumer service and request for a reimbursement. The answer I received was that I wasn't eligible for compensation, because my luggage was delivered within 24 hours.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Could not disagree more with two recent reviews. My trip Athens to London with Aegean was a very professional and comfortable experience. From easy and polite check-in at Athens International to the goodbye at the cabin door upon arrival by excellent cabin crew, the service is seamless. Seating is decent for a 3 and a half hour flight and they offer a full service of drinks and hot meals. Great vegetarian pasta. Aegean is far superior to other European carriers and I would choose Aegean any day. Thoroughly recommended.",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Frankfurt to Athens. It might be my impression but it feels like the legroom has been reduced, seats are awful and  uncomfortable. The customer service is  average along with the cleanliness of the aircraft. As long as the flight is fully booked the land crew requests from clients to board with just the hand luggage and deliver the carry-on luggage to the hold (free of charge as they claim). This review was written with the value-for-money in mind as the primary factor. Hence there is no reason at all booking the tickets with Aegean if you are about to pay more and receive the same legroom and seat-comfort to any other low-cost flying company Since Aegean allows its passengers to fly in Economy/Go-Light with the standard carry-on luggage and handbag allowance (as stated on their ticket), they should adhere to that. The reason passengers do that is because it allows them to quickly grab their bags and catch the next flight without having to wait on the belt to retrieve luggage. I agree with the company's policy to weigh/measure the carry-on luggage prior to boarding in order to filter any passengers carrying excessive carry-ons. However as long as the passenger is compliant  they shouldn't force him/her deliver their carry-on to the hold. I am a Silver member over the past 3 years and during this flight I requested for my ticket to be upgraded. However the representative assured me that I wasn't able since the flight was in cooperation with Lufthansa. When I asked to upgrade only the ticket from Frankfurt to Athens (operated by Aegean) they declined providing me the same reason. Yet they didn't forget to email me a ""Bid to Upgrade your Seat"" email.",no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Berlin to Thessaloniki via Athens. Not the best flight with Aegean. Cabin was old and the crew on both flights not very helpful and charming. As a gold member, I was cramped on both flights in full rows.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Athens to Kiev. Among the top European airlines. Price is always reasonable and service is always perfect. I never had any problem and I always choose when available. ,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Lisbon to Athens. One more time with Aegean! Excellent as always, on time, crew friendly and approachable, hot meal and drinks for free, clean aircraft. Don't know if you need more from an airline if you fly in Europe",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10, We missed our connecting flight to Larnaca twice due to delays first of Lufthansa and then of Aegean. We ended up with a route of 4 flights from Hamburg to LCA with total trip duration of 24 hours. The ground staff of Aegean at the gate requested me to leave my carry-on baggage at the gate to be picked up at luggage claim at LCA as the plane was full. I kindly explained that I’m traveling with a companion who had his carryon with him and we had to get a taxi together immediately after arrival. The ground staff showed no consideration and insisted that it is the airlines regulation. She spoke rudely with a loud voice.,no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  London to Athens. Check in, and lounge all went well. The staff on board not as professional as my last flight. My food in business class was an absolute disgrace, I have never been served this on any airline (beef stew and eggplant mash).  Limited drinks and no black tea. I paid for business class but It was a waste of money.",no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Larnaca to Athens. I can understand that if plane arrives late at night, it can park away from the terminal, but in this case parking away and using the bus seems to be a common feature. On this flight arriving at 09.50 in the morning at a half empty airport at Athens and again the bus. Otherwise as an airline apart from higher costs, Aegean could be given top marks though passenger legroom was limited.",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10, Athens to Tel Aviv with Aegean Airlines. Very nice and welcoming air crew helped all passengers to quickly find space and seats. I was supersized they served light dinner – Warm Pasta and biscuits and a variety of drinks. Seat are 3x3 and packed but for 2 hour flight its OK.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  
Athens to London. Very pleasant flight by Aegean Airlines. One of the best airlines in Europe. It was a fully flight from Athens to LHR. Boarding was done efficiently. The crew are this airlines best asset and they are excellent. Friendly and approachable. A hot meal and 2 drink runs. Any request and the crew were obliging. What other airline in Europe would serve a hot meal in economy now days. Excellent European airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Mykonos to Athens via Santorini. Prices for flights were reasonable. Carry on regulations are not enforced and you have some passengers showing up thinking the rules somehow don’t apply to them, with shopping bags, purses, oversized luggage etc. The experience with crowding, pushing and a race for the overhead luggage compartments. Boarding is a cattle call with no zones or row sequence. All this being said we took 5 flights in 14 days with this airline and I have to give them marks for being on time. Planes sparsely equipped but for 30-60 minute flights it really didn’t matter, nor did the awful snacks of Oreo like cookies, bad coffee and hard candy I think most passengers could have done without. Flight attendants were very presentable but definitely not overworked. Loading, deplaning, unnecessary crowded short bus rides and transfers at Athens airport will try your patience sometimes sending you through security twice for no reason. Pay the reasonable flight costs, close your eyes and just hope it ends as quickly as it can.",no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Athens to Vienna. Outbound the plane was so narrow seated that even myself of medium height could hardly move, food - the good old pasta as always, and though it was a midday flight at 14.40 we were taken to the plane on the bus. The flight was smooth, inflight staff the best asset of this airline, otherwise as good as any other airline though the use of passenger bridges is not within the programme of Aegean. Front rows 1- 12 you have to pay for them plus 25 euros for your check in luggage, 30 to London. No in flight entertainment.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Cairo to Prague via Athens, friendly staff (cabin crew, check in employees), great service, hot food served , clean aircraft. Not the first time with Aegean Airlines and they are always improving, keep up the great work. You deserve to be the best airline in Europe.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Aegean Airlines has a consistently good service that ranges from customer service on the phone center to very friendly and welcoming cabin crew. The flight left on time, the airplane was spotlessly clean and pilot provided information several times. Food during flight was delicious. The only negative thing I can mention is the crowded lounge (which otherwise has a great choice of food and beverages) in the mornings when several Aegean airplanes are departing at the same time. In general, flying Aegean is always a pleasant experience for me with a good value for money.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Sofia. Excellent value for the money I paid (93 Canadian dollars). Seats were comfortable, airplane was clean, great staff service. This is the 3d time I take them. I flew with Aegean 3 years ago and once again they deliver and are worthy of their 4 star rating. I was not expecting food to be offered on this flight; make sure you make your meal request well in advance, otherwise there may not be anything vegetarian. (This was my fault). All I can say is that the food looked like it was good quality and they offer a reasonable selection of beverages.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Booked the flight from Palermo to Athens with Aegean. The flight was operated by Olympic Air, which I didn't mind. Boarding was efficient and we departed in time. The plane was a bit dated compared to the rest Aegean fleet. Onboard service was really good, with full service. Especially the two FAs, Eirini and Myrto, were really attentive, kind and reassuring. Always Aegean is my top choice for travel.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Athens to Munich. The ground staff in Athens is unpolite and rude, if the onboard bag is 1-2kg too heavy charging them 50€. Calling each passenger to their desk who didn't book any extra baggage. I'll never fly with this airline again. The food on board is really bad for me. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Hamburg to Rhodes via Athens. Check-in was friendly and professional, also the boarding. The route HAM-ATH took place in Business Class, the onward flight to RHO in Economy. The service of business class was impeccable. There was a 3-course menu, the main course could be chosen from 2 courts. There were several wines to choose from, as well as soft drinks, beer, spirits, coffee, espresso, etc. Typically on European flights was the 3 seats, with the middle seat was free. The seats were comfortable, although a little tighter as the table is in the armrest. After the delayed landing in Athens, the business guests were taken to the terminal in a separate bus, so it was not a problem to get the connecting flight. The onward flight in economy class was fine. It was a snack and drink, the staff was friendly. 
 DE: Check-in war freundlich und professionell, ebenfalls das Boarding. Die Strecke HAM-ATH erfolgte in der Business Class, der Weiterflug nach RHO in Economy. Der Service der Business Class war einwandfrei. Es gab ein 3 Gänge Menü, die Hauptspeise konnte aus 2 Gerichten gewählt werden. Dazu gab es mehrere Weine zur Auswahl, sowie Softdrinks, Bier, Spirituosen, Kaffee, Espresso, etc. Typisch auf Europaflügen war der 3er Bestuhlung, wobei der mittlere Sitz frei blieb. Die Sitze waren bequem, obwohl etwas enger, da der Tisch in der Armlehne untergebracht ist. Nach der verspäteten Landung in Athen wurden die Business Gäste in einem eigenen Bus zum Terminal gebracht, daher war es kein Problem den Anschlussflug zu bekommen. Der Weiterflug in der Economy Class war in Ordnung. Es wurde ein Snack und Getränk gereicht, das Personal war freundlich.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  I took this airline from Rome to Athens on July 30th and my checked in baggage was damaged. One of the wheels was missing and my suitcase was cracked. I went to the desk where they were handling this situation. I reported it and emailed them the day of the incident. I didn’t receive an email back until the end of August. One of their associates informed me that they can compensate for the damage and give me €80. I gave them my banking information, they said over and over again that she still needed an “Intermediary SWIFT code” as it is necessary for non-EU people. I went to my bank Chase, and they had never heard of that, so I called the wire transfer department at Chase and they informed me that the recipient should have the Intermediary SWIFT code. I already gave them the information they needed so now it’s their turn to transfer the amount. I still haven’t received my compensation from the airline. ",no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Athens to Munich. Lounge in ATH was a disappointment. We expected a full breakfast for this early flight. Unfortunately only continental breakfast was provided. On board, everything fine. Clean aircraft, nice staff and reasonable food. A standard now on European routes, when flying Star alliance. Note for the excellent airshow.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  ATH - LHR, 8 September 2019. Check in was a breeze at the very comfortable Athens International Airport. Polite and friendly Aegean staff on hand to assist with Self Check in counters. A smile and a sense of humour made the process easy and informative. No excess charges necessary for luggage. I really don't understand people who post reviews on here and bemoan the fact that they have to pay extra if their bags exceed the permitted baggage allowance. You will have to pay more regardless of airline so use your common sense and educate yourself about your permitted allowance. Boarding was undertaken in an orderly manner. Greeted at the aircraft door with a very warm welcome by immaculate looking cabin crew. Flawless hair and make up. Elegant and functional uniform. Departed with a 20 minute delay. Drink service commenced shortly after followed by a very tasty, hot and well presented vegetarian meal. One of the best I have experienced. Great service from the crew. Aegean is one of the few airlines in Europe that offers a full service on board and is to be congratulated. Landed 5 minutes ahead of schedule. Great flight, excellent crew. Shall definately be flying Aegean Airlines again. Good job.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10," London to Santorini via Athens. Aegean charges an exorbitant price for minimal weight excess. Be sure you will be charged £55 for an extra kilo. It is certainly the most unfair airline I've ever been. There were no prior email warning/reminders, which other airlines have the decency to do so. Ryanair hanks way higher on fairness and customer service. I can securely say that I'll never fly with Aegan again.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Heraklion to Athens. First attendants skipped my son when serving water. When he asked attendant for water, she replied just a second and just went on serving other passengers. When I asked another flight attendant if we could get some water. She politely replied that was no problem and disappeared.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew with Aegean from Athens to Catania. The flight with Aegean was once again exceptional. Modern aircraft, very friendly and helpful crew, entertainment system (Aegean Stream). The FAs managed very good work despite the full cabin. The food was nice (sandwiches), yet I would like to have a hot meal on shorter intl routes, as most flights with Aegean. The only thing I can complain about is the boarding procedure. During both boarding in ATH and disembarkation in CTA we used buses, despite the fact that there were available jetbridges in Catania airport. Overall a very good flight, with value for money (108 EUROS during high season).",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10, Athens to Zurich. Once again flying with Aegean was a disappointment in terms of comfort. The “free” seats do not have adequate room for an adult measuring more than 180cm. When seated one has to sit upright and yet the knees are hitting on the seat in front and the passenger can effectively not move. This was implemented by Aegean two years ago in order to save one extra row of seats on the plane as well as to increase its revenues from disappointed passengers who could not tolerate this discomfort and would pay for a set upgrade. Shame for a company that does not see itself (and not charges) as a low cost airline yet treats its economy passengers as such.,no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  The flight was operated by Olympic Air, Q400. Plane was ok; both flights were 30 minutes late even though we were boarded plane on time. Service for the 1 hr 55 min flight was basic, sandwich and fruits, water, beer, wine. Very friendly cabin crew, especially on the flight ATH-SJJ were great because they offered to give me theirs lunch which was a fruit salad, because I had option of and they had only tuna sandwich, or ham & cheese sandwich.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Zakynthos to Athens, flight on Olympic Airline codes, operated by Aegean Airlines, on a very early morning. Flight was on time, embarkation and disembarkation was by bus, however easy and quick. Used e-check in, very simple and the boarding pass is sent by sms to the snartphone with a link. The app was not needed. Got seat 1A. Flight 70% full and arrival was 15' ahead of schedule. We were offered water/juice and a biscuit. Booked this ticket by redeeming points through the Aegean Miles & Bonus scheme, so it was very cheap.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Sofia to Beirut via Athens. Once again an amazing experience with this airline. Flights on time, hot meal (on 1h 20’ flight), comfortable seats, clean cabin, friendly and professional crew. This is why Aegean has been my first choice in recent years. I hope they keep up the good service they are offering and do not downgrade. Frankly, I can’t say anything bad. Love Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  Misleading information on Aegean website. Purchasing on-line a Economy GoLight ticket Santorini to Athens on Aegean website and being a Star Alliance Gold member, I estimated that I was entitled to 23 kg free checked baggage. I knew that some flights might be operated by Olympic Air. I based by understanding on the following assessments on Aegean website, when purchasing the ticket: A-""The number of bags, the charges and allowable dimensions may vary depending on your flight, the fare (GoLight, Flex & Business) and the Class (Economy or Business) in which you are travelling. That is why we advise you to check the specific baggage information either on the AEGEAN website or your booking before every flight. "" B-""Miles+Bonus Gold* & Star Alliance Gold :3 pieces 32 kg in Business or 2 pieces 23kg in Economy Flex or 1 piece 23kg in Economy GoLight 158 cm (62 inches)"" C-""Important notes regarding baggage: This baggage policy applies only on flights operated by AEGEAN and Olympic Air aircraft."" However, when checking-in at airport, staff acknowledged by Star Alliance Gold status with priority tagging my sole luggage, BUT charged me US$35,00 (more than 50% of the cost to the ticket, and more than if I had purchased this extra luggage previously to the flight) for that same sole baggage, based on the fact that ""flight number is a Olympic number and not an Aegean"". I insisted, but no way.  I paid and complained later to Aegean Customer Service, that in a first moment repeated the same reason, as if any pax were able to identify airlines flights codes, and as if what is on websites have no value. After a second complain I received a tiny compensation in Status miles credit.",no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  London to Athens. A good experience on Aegean Airlines. It's one of the better airlines in Europe. They serve a hot meal and plenty of drink runs in economy.  The crew were professional. The boarding was orderly and quick, slightly delayed but it was made up in flight speed. The seat pitch is tight as both flight's were full it was cramped. More than 3 hours and it would be hell. Crew didn't clean the toilets. It was unclean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"  Athens to Larnaca. My flight was delayed but this happens on many airlines, however this airline avoids the use of airbridges, and on my flights they prefer to use a bus. Even under heavy rain or snow or freezing temps. This was the case again, get on the bus and then on the plane parked far away at Athens temps of 39C, boiling hot. For the return flight, delayed for more than half an hour (no traffic excuse), the captain was American and the announcement made was only in English, hence passengers were wondering what was he talking about, no Greek translation was given.",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  Athens to Rome. 4 flights, all of them late. Flight from Athens to Mykonos took off 2 hours and 40 minutes after the scheduled time. They apologised with an 8€ meal voucher that arrived by email when we were already boarded, and another one way voucher ""valid for travelling within one year with the exception of the period from 20th December to 10th January, Easter as well as the week that follows, and during July and August"". Almost useless. On the way back flight to Rome was 45 minutes late. ",no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,  Rome  to Larnaca to via Athens. The main problem was dropping off our luggage at Rome airport. Only two service points available and had to wait for 45 minutes in the queue. ,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Berlin to Athens. Aegean are in most respects an excellent airline. But you should be warned never to buy goods from their in flight shop. I bought a pair of Bluetooth headphones. They were extremely uncomfortable not being large enough for an average adult male head. It was clear from the moment I put them on that they were not ""fit for purpose"" and only really suitable for a child. Aegean refused to take them back even though from my point of view the goods were faulty as no adult male could wear them comfortably. So experience the excellent service Aegean provide but avoid the temptation to buy goods in the air. If they are totally unsuitable you won't get a refund.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Athens to Bucharest with Aegean Airlines. This company has services which go from bad to worse. Last year they were bad, now they are worst. Much worse. The tagging of the luggage was a never ending process with maximum bothering system, consisting in 3 different people from the Aegean trying to use scanners which were not working and redirecting us from one to the other. The process lasted long to infinite because we were seven persons in the group. Moreover, after that, when boarding the bus which lead to the plane, the personnel insisted in a more than aggressive voice and body language in us going into a very crowded bus in which there wasnt any room left for us. More than that, we explained that we could not separate the members of our group because we were 7 and not everyone was speaking english. They separated us nevertheless between two different buses and one of the passengers had a panic attack. We are very malcontent and disappointed with the attitude of the people working for this company with which we interacted during this flight. And the flight was 45 minutes late, of course, this could not have missed from the final picture!",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10," After a nightmare experience with United (who rebooked us with their Star Alliance partner Aegean) including several delays, and cancellations, we arrived in Athens to no luggage, which was United's responsibility, not Aegean's. We dealt with United for four days trying to get our luggage from Newark to Athens. Eventually they told us to Taxi back to the airport and promised our luggage was there, a very kind supervisor came out and talked to us to explain the luggage was not, in fact, there. (We did not even ask for a supervisor.) He was very understanding and patient and asked us to trust him. At this point our time in Athens was over and we left the airport to board our cruise ship, thinking there was no way we'd ever get our luggage in the middle of the ocean. The next night there it was in our cabin when we opened the door! We couldn't believe it. The supervisor had gotten our luggage from Newark to Athens, then onto Santorini Island, where our Princess Cruise ship then transported it from the island and onto the ship and then to our room - all within a day. In all we went five days without luggage, but once Aegean was involved we had it within about a day, in a much more difficult route than it would have been for United to simply put it on the plane to Athens. Everyone was so compassionate and kind. But it didn't end there. Upon arriving home, I began the impossible task of dealing with United to receive compensation - they had told us to keep all receipts for the five days without luggage and we had. We spent hours on hold, hours on the phone, getting nowhere. Finally, based on the File Reference number (that I'd given them over and over and over) someone finally clued in and explained the International agreement that wherever you end up is who is responsible for the luggage. Wait, so we get to deal with Aegean again? Wonderful! I called and a kind man explained exactly what to do and gave me an email. In less than a day I got a response telling me exactly what to do to make a very easy process go smoothly. I've spent three weeks with United and got nowhere, while being treated rudely. In the last few days everything has been submitted to Aegean in a easy process with a kind person on the other end helping. We wouldn't have realized how amazing Aegean is had we not had such a bad experience through their sister airline, that only Aegean resolved, for them. Aegean went above and beyond, with every person we dealt with, they will be the first we use if at all possible. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  I had two wonderful flights on Aegean Airlines on June 18th and on June 27th between Dusseldorf and Athens. The cabin crew was excellent: They took care of each guest, they were on both segments present at all times with a natural smile and much kindness! I‘ve flown Aegean several times and they really deserve the top ranking. From check-in till baggage-delivery everything went totally smooth! An Airline with an outstanding standard of operation. Delicious meals with a Greek touch, Greek wines and spirits as well as Cappuccino and Espresso on demand! This is truly not common even in Business Class on flights within Europe these days.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10, Athens to Madrid. The perfect flight. They gave us breakfast for free in economy class. It was punctual and the staff very kind. The plane was new but it was like flying with an old airline because of the treatment of the staff.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10," Athens to Beirut. One of the nicest airlines I have ever flown! The staff were really professional and friendly, the seats were very comfortable and the food was delicious with a great selection of drinks. The seats were very comfortable and the atmosphere was very pleasant. I would give 10/10 if only the plane wasn't delayed twice. However, it was only 30 mins. Highly recommend!",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,  Athens to Heraklion. Our flight from Rhodes to Athens with Aegean Airlines was quite late so upon arrival into Athens we knew it would be a tight connection even though the flight from Athens to Heraklion was still at the airport and this flight was late anyway. We got to the gate to be told the flight had been closed and we were booked onto the next flight.  We asked if they could re-open the flight and get us on. They issued the new boarding passes for the next flight and my partner and I were not sitting together as we were just added to the next flight. We asked them to seat us together but they said there was nothing they could do. The annoying things was that the ground and lounge staff didn't try to accommodate us and get us onto our original flight. The crew on the flight were OK but catering was awful for the 50 mins flight. ,no
Aegean Airlines,7/10," Madrid to Athens. Online booking process very straightforward and easy. Their fares are very competitive. Very easy boarding process, the staff are friendly and helpful. My wife and I flew Madrid to Athens round trip, both airplanes were clean, good legroom, service fine. Meals, well airplane meals are similar, these were okay, the good thing is they included wine in Economy. This has been our only experience with Aegean and we were very satisfied. Good airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Santorini to London  via Athens. When my sister and I checked in for the Santorini to Athens flights we had two rollerbags which were labeled cabin baggage on check in by Aegean. (A355 3 June) On our continuing flight to London (A3602 3 June), the gate agent stopped us and demanded that we pay 60 euros for one of our carryons despite the fact they were tagged by Aegean on our previous connecting flight. He would not let us on the plane unless we paid him. We finally paid to not hold up other travelers but in the confusion of this my purse was left on his counter. (not the main check in counter but the one to the side of the door where he collected the money). Immediately upon getting to my seat I noticed the purse missing. I asked the three stewardesses at the front of the plane if I could retrieve my purse at that counter. The man charging us the baggage fee at the last minute could also have run the purse down, and didn't. I could not leave the plane to go up the ramp but they did not offer for one of them to get it for me; and instead waited for a young baggage boy to go see it it was there. What could have been accomplished in 5 minutes took at least 15 or more. He came back and said he did not see it. Literally, it was only 5 minutes from the time we got to our seat to when I could have had a stewardess check the countertop. The attendants could have called the gate but didn't or one of them gone to that counter, but they did not. On arrival at Heathrow, the departure agent called Athens for me and the purse was at lost and found with greek police at airport. They had it at the ticket check in stand after all! They gave me the reference number of 2294 and said to call DHL (maybe UPS) to have it couriered to me. I am not a business and have no way of putting the purse (small fabric dark grey shoulder bag 10 x 12"") in a box with a label which was suggested for pickup. Aegean Air, when contacted, said I would have to go through Greek lost and found and could offer no further assistance. I will pay if needed for it to be sent. I obviously am not in Athens and do not know anyone to pick the purse up for me there. The ticket agent in London was helpful but all of the numbers I have tried to reach since then either don't respond or give me another number that doesn't respond. He also said we should not have been charged the 60 euros at the last minute on the continuing flight. After calls and emails the airline finally did say they would credit the charge. It now has taken me five days and numerous long distance calls to get my purse returned. Hopefully this coming week UPS in conjunction with an exceptionally helpful lady in lost and found may be able to return my purse. ",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Larnaca return for work. Flights full both ways and punctual. Used the app to check in - very easy and convenient - still able to choose seats, some without charge - a charge applies to the front seats or the extra leg space ones. I was traveling with hand luggage only, however decided to check it in for free. Embarkation done on time and with order. People always trying to get in as much cabin bags as they can, however personnel handled the situation well, taking some on hold and I did not see them fining anybody. Light meal and refreshments served on this 1h30min flight. The return flight was very turbulent all the way, so they served the food, but stopped the drinks service early on. The majority of the passengers did not get anything to drink. Some passengers panicking and vomiting, but the crew managed It well, calming passengers and maintaining a good spirit.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Milano to Chania via Athens. I received an email from Aegean for upgrade (but I did not notice that the upgrade was only for the flight Milano-Athens). My offer (80 euros) was accepted.  For the flight I had two handbags of 3.5 and 7.5 kg as permitted for Business class (less than the 5 and 8 kg allowance for each handbag). It was only in Athens that I was asked to pay for one of these handbags (Athens-Chania was still economy and only one luggage is permitted) either 60 euros in the gate (with a fine) or to run to check-in 124 of Aegean to pay 25 euros. I had to pay for a handbag of 7.5kg 25 euros. If they had informed me in Milano when I checked in my luggage that I would have to pay for the one handbag in Athens, I would have put the content of small handbag in one of my luggage, since there was space in my baggage. The use of the lounge of Aegean in Athens was not permitted. I wrote to Aegean and customer relations department of Aegean who replied and stated twice only that the flight Athens to Chania was economy.  As for the space in the business class. If you get the seats 1A or 1 C is fine. I was in 1F and the space was not something that is worth the money. Also, in row 2 the seats seems to be like the space in the seats+ (why pay for business class?). The folded tables that are opened from the arm of the chair are not convenient.",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Munich to Thessaloniki. Good flight and still the only airline that can really be called full service for inter Europe flights. Departure from MUC was an hour late but time was made up during the flight. Onboard staff were friendly and a hot meal was served for breakfast. I am not sure the choice of the pastry is the best item as it was a bit stodgy, bread rolls however were hot and fresh can’t remember that last time that happened on a flight even in business class. Boarding in MUC was via airbridge deplaned via bus. Very comfortable flight.",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,  Athens to London. Slightly disappointed by the crew this time round. A passenger behind me asked for tea during the pre-lunch drinks service and was told that only soft drinks were available (not true as Aegean offers wine and beer in its European economy).,yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10," Athens to London Heathrow. I am a gold member of Aegean and since 2 years ago the quality is becoming worse every day. The quality of food in business class is very poor. We were offered lamp and there was not a single piece of meat, only fat. The distance between the rows is extremely small unless you pay extra. I paid 567 euro for this flight and obviously I didn’t want to pay not even 1 euro extra. Practices of low cost companies with tickets of an extremely expensive one. Very disappointed.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10, Athens to Vienna. Really unhelpful staff. The app is confusing and it left out my name down twice for the two tickets I purchased. Went to check in and realised this so called and was told I’d get my money back but instead they charged me double the price I paid for the ticket and said they were doing me a favour!,no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Athens to Larnaca. Aegean is a very professional airline, I have experienced many many flights with them, aircraft though cramped are in excellent condition, flight attendants are given top marks, whilst snacks etc at least on some routes are getting below average, for example on this flight we were given a tasteless small piece of bread which looked like a pie.. As on many airlines you have to pay for check in luggage, pay for a seat if you choose the first 12 rows etc. In general a punctual and reliable airline, but ever so often they avoid jet step walkways and this is my constant complaint, as it has happened many many times especially on this route to Larnaca, or even Munich and London.. On this flight for example we arrived under torrential rain, the airport at Larnaca was half empty and Aegean parked at a distance, go down the stairs, get wet, into the bus and then the drive to the underground entry to the airport.",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10," Thessaloniki to Athens with Aegean Airlines. I felt cheated by the way they handled my luggage, which by all means did not exceed the maximum weight. The supervisor claimed that my luggage had to loosely fit in the paper box they were using to size the luggage. They charged me an additional $40 euros for the luggage when on the same trip I traveled with AA and Iberia and they gave me no problems with it. On top of it, the supervisor was rude. ",no
Aegean Airlines,6/10," On 22th of August 2018, I was traveling with OA flight 254 Athens to Mytilene operated by Aegean. I am a gold member and with me were travelling my parents, my father with special assistance as he has had a coronary angiography. When I went to the lounge and asked at the front office to have my parents as guests, the answer was that I can take only one guest and it’s not possible to take both because the regulation is that only one guest can go with a Gold member. I replied that I know the regulation but due my father’s health circumstances, if they could make an exception and he could sit in a quiet place until boarding the aircraft, the response was again negative, only my father could come with me and my mother should wait outside. At this point I was wondering what would be happening if my mother came with us in an almost empty lounge. Probably they were afraid that they would eat the cheeses at the buffet. I was expecting something more from Aegean as they advertise all the time that: Aegean is civilization, they definitely have a strange idea about what civilization is.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Edinburgh to Rhodes via Athens. We have flown to Rhodes several times using holiday airlines, however last year we decided to use Aegean Air. I must say the experience was great, customer service was friendly and always felt taken care of during the flight. We enjoyed our Aegean Air experience so much we decided to book our next flight in October 19 to Rhodes for our honeymoon. We got a good deal with our flights, however we wished to extend our stay in Rhodes by 3/4 days and Aegean air were going to charge us double our flight cost for us both plus 50 euro each booking fees for changing a flight from a Thursday to Monday. This is rather high for changing one part of our flight. We were rather disappointied that we couldnt extend our stay in Rhodes due to the very high transfer charge - even although the flight isnt until October and its only April. This is rather annoying as they have ben such a good airline to deal with previously.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  LGW-ATH-LHR Aegean Airlines. Aegean has kept up the high standards; on time, clean aircraft and excellent value for money. Hot meals and sweets on both sectors, with several rounds of drinks. Aegean's economy class offering on medium haul is akin to business class with other airlines. The return fare was £200 cheaper than British Airways who charge for sandwiches and drinks; BA's buy on board concept isn't suitable for destinations like Athens,Istanbul, Larnaca which are not 'short' haul. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Samos to Heraklion via Athens. Aegean Airlines is probably the best airline in Greece, and its service meets higher end companies like Air France. The seats comfortable and space is enough. They rarely have delays and its overall a great experience. The prices for regional routes are quite high, but if you can book a month or two early, you can get a fair deal. Their miles and bonus system I think is below average and generally the promotions with banks to provide cheaper or free flights usually fails to meet expectations. All in all, I believe Aegean airlines is a very honest and professional Airline that meets most of the expectations you can have for a trip!",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10," 
I've travelled with Aegean Airlines in the past and I've been always satisfied with that airline. This time was no exception. I took two flight over the last week. All the fights left on time and arrived early. Check in process in Athens airport was fine and no big line ups. The check in agent even manages to tag my bags to my final destination with a partner airline and they did follow. The crew on all the flights were nice and welcoming. They even helped to make space and store carry on bags in the overheard compartments so the flight could leave as soon as possible. They even hand out candy before take off which makes a nice touch of a warm Greek welcome. There's a complementary meal or snack provided depending on the flight time with a selection of drinks. Aegean Airlines is one the best airlines and the service has improved a lot over the past years. The only downside is that they don't operate flights to the USA or Canada. I will defenetly fly back with them later this year.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"  This review is about the Miles & Bonus Scheme. Aegean are focusing on their in-flight quality of service which is indeed very good. On the other hand their prices can be high even for short distance flights and their Miles & Bonus scheme is a joke. Although I have accumulated a great deal of spending miles, it seems I cannot spend any since in order to find free slots, I have to foresee a trip many months before and it has to not fall within their busy periods, making it pretty impossible to spend them. Even if you want to use the miles to fly 2-3 months ahead, you have to be willing to fly with other star alliance carriers and through other destinations (transit), hence doubling your flight time and hassle. I am a silver card holder (need one more flight to become gold), and I am entitled to 2 upgrades per year from economy to business class. Whenever I try to use these upgrades there never seem to be any available slots/seats. Then a year passes and these vouchers expire. The new trend is to put you on a waiting list and if the flight doesn't get full on that day, then they might upgrade you, but you can't know before the actual day of the trip.",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10," Athens to Heraklion. Arrival at the airport baggage drop off area, only one counter was servicing 4-5 flights of that time period, while a second one had computer problems and 2 others for B/C and 1 for Special Services were just standing looking the line piling up. When protested about the waiting time which was around 25 mins, no one offered to help with checking in. A second disappointment occurred in the aircraft, where the crew didn't manage (once more) to complete the inflight beverage service. Rather tired from the previous duty, left half of the cabin unserved. Overall, Aegean seems to follow the bad path of the sole Greek air provider by service and quality rapid degradation.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,  Athens to Paris. Quite rude security check after passport control when boarding starts. One manager asked to take my passport without any greeting and was looking at me for 20 seconds and then just got back my passport without saying a word. It was a feeling like I’m a second class citizen maybe because I have Russian passport. ,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Amsterdam. Business class was a good value. Used the app to check in, pretty easy, selected seat whilst making the booking (1A). Fast track security was very fast (although Athens airport is very fast all the times). Went to their lounge, which was very nice, with a good selection of food and drinks. Priority boarding was efficient, warm towel was given 2 times (after take off and after meal). The service was excellent and the food delicious - a traditional Greek meal cooked in a modern way (grilled sea bream and spinach with rice with a touch of lemon). It looked like a young male flight attendand was being trained and the more senior staff were very helpful and supportive to him. Very cheerful and smiling throughout the flight. Pleasant flight and care for the passenger.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Flying with my family from Lax to EWR and than London with United. London to Athens with Aegean Airlines. So happy that we arrived in London and finally we had a flight with Aegean back to Athens. The flights with United was terrible, rude people from the check in at LAX until the and in London. Dear Aegean, you are really small if I compare you with United but you have to give some lessons to them, to tell them about service and “philoxenia”! Living in Samos Island and many times I’m flying Aegean and never disappointed! Hopefully in the future you can fly over the Atlantic too. You have the best aircraft service.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Bucharest return on evening flights. Outbound flight about 65% full, return flight almost full. Flights on time, snack and drinks offered within the ticket price, were good and offered with a smile. Travelled with hand luggage, but checked it in for free on our outbound flight - that was pretty relaxing. Orderly boarding generally and arrived on time. Tried to use their streaming app, it worked fine, however you need to have your earphones with you (for music and films). Only negative was that in Bucharest a lot of people boarded as gold/family/disabled, when clearly they were not entitled, making it unfair for the rest of the passengers (for example a lady with a 14 year old daughter, or a group of adult youngsters).",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Athens to Tirana. First impressions are lasting impressions. I would fly Aegean again based on our experience. Boarding process was smooth; however, I didn't see why they had two lines when everyone was boarding the same bus to the airplane. Flight Crew was very pleasant. A light Mediterranean style breakfast was served along with complimentary beverages for a flight that is about an hour and 40 minutes in length. Cf, British Airways for a 3 hours flight to Athens (no meal or complimentary beverages). I was able to log on to the Aegean Flight Stream; however, it did not appear to work. We were seated in the exit row with plenty of legroom and width in the seats.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  London to Larnaca via Athens. Excellent crew and value for money. One of the few airlines to serve free food/snacks and drinks in flight. My flight from Heathrow was delayed and I had a connection in Athens. Surprisingly, they have connection ambasadors (as Aegean calls them) which are waiting for once you arrive to guide you on your next flight (if both flights are operated by Aegean or Olympic). The seats were comfortable enough as well. I am a star alliance member too. I have flown many times with Aegean and they never let me down. Very pleased.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10," 
I flew on Aegean from Athens to Cairo, a direct flight and when I arrived in Cairo I received a text informing me that my bag did not arrive in Cairo with me. When I checked my bag that morning 2.5 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart, the rude airline employee put my bag on the conveyor belt after tagging it. The belt stopped and reversed, the bag came back, and I asked the Aegean rep. why. She said without looking at me, ""It's overweight! Take it go over there!"" and then she ignored me. I said, ""I just flew yesterday with your airline and the bag weighed 20.3 kg and there is nothing new in it."" She kept ignoring me so I went to a different line, where I waited for 30 minutes to be told my bag was not overweight and indeed did weigh 20.3 kg. In Cairo, when I found out my bag had not arrived, I saw that most of the other passengers on my flight had not gotten theirs either. In fact, I later learned that Aegean Airlines had misplaced or lost the luggage of passengers of five different flights in two days! I had to fill out a form and get a complaint number. I expected to hear from the airline that day telling me they had located my bag, but that didn't happen. The next day I got a message from WorldTracer, a luggage tracing service, that my bag had been located ""pending confirmation."" For an entire week that message remained on the site. I had one email from Aegean Airlines customer service department informing me the day after my flight that my bag had been located and was being flown to Cairo but that proved not to be true. I emailed and called Aegean Airlines and never got a straight answer about where my bag was. I got emails that told me to ""rest assured"" that they were doing everything they could to resolve the problem. They never returned my calls and only repeated information about being reimbursed for ""first needs"" for up to 40 euros per day. The list of information they needed to approve reimbursement was ridiculously long. Finally, a week later and only minutes after speaking with another Aegean Airlines customer services rep. and being told they didn't know the whereabouts of my luggage but were doing everything they could to find it, I got an email from the lost luggage office in Cairo airport telling me my bag had been delivered there and I could pick it up. It cost me two taxi rides and five hours to retrieve my bag from the airport. I spent a week not knowing if I'd ever see my belongings again. Deeply regrettably, I still have one flight ahead of me with this terrible airline and I dread turning over my belongings to them. When I asked them for an upgrade for that flight, they told me they weren't able to do that. I'm sorry I can't change my flight. ",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,  Too tight seats and quite humble food. The worst was that my suitcase did not reach Cairo and was left behind in transit. The management of the lost and found was too bad. After two hours of waiting they made us fill a form and promised to call to give updates. They gave us a number to call for inquiry. That number in Cairo never answers. No other numbers available. They didn’t call. I called the HQ in Athens they couldn’t help. It is 12 hours since my flight arrived.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Dublin to Athens. It was a rather nice flight. It is the first time I flew Aegean. We did get a snack and drink on board. I will fly them again as the service was great and outstanding.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Athens to Prague. I am flying with Aegean Airlines about 4 - 5 times per year and I have enjoyed every trip. I can always find a normal price for the flight, the aircrafts are clean, the staff is so polite and welcoming and the snacks always fresh and tasty. In the Prague airport, the service is as it should be always. Mine only complaints have to do with the airport in Athens, as always are unnecessary delays. The flight to Prague is not using a gateway to the aircraft, but a bus. There is still a priority to Gold and Silver members, for no reason in that case, since everyone will get on a bus. Also, another thing that I had complained in the past in the company's support contact form, is about other's passenger's cabin luggage, which in many are too big in comparison with the proper aircraft cabin luggage. As a result, most of the times, there is an announcement for giving cabin luggage without extra cost in order to be stored in the cargo compartment of the plane. This seems unfair for the people who are typical with their luggage.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Athens to Munich. Hospitality and smiles from aircraft staff. Very responsive on requests and always ""non stop"" team work to have everyone pleased. Very clean and good seats. Nice weather assisted to perform such a lovely flight to Munich.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  
Gatwick to Athens. A late departure of 90 minutes caused by early morning fog at Gatwick which had delayed the incoming flight from Athens was handled competently with regular updates from the flight deck including information for those with connecting flights. Aegean are still a full service airline. Lunch was a chicken and rice dish, which was perfectly adequate, with a full bar service. Athens arrival was to a remote stand with bus connection to the terminal. This all worked well but there was a disappointingly long wait at immigration for EU citizens with no wait for 'other' passports. More an airport issue than an Aegean one. Overall a thoroughly competent performance.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10," Amman to Athens. There is nothing to write about this flight.  Aegean Airlines delivered what was important: air travel from point A to point B, on-time, reasonably comfortable, with decent service. What more you could ask for?",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  A good, hassle free airline with a nice customer service. There was no delay but they didn’t provide me food on route from Paris to Athens. The plane was new and I could not hear the plane sound during flight. So my ear didn’t hurt.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Cairo to Munich via Athens. We flew Aegean because their flight was convenient, not too expensive and the fee for extra luggage was very fair. We moved back from Egypt to Germany, so we had a lot of luggage. Check-in was done by Egypt Air staff and was efficient. We were allowed by airport security to use an unused check-in counter to check the weight of our luggage and we had to repack a bit, so when we checked in, our 5 suitcases matched the weight-requirement exactly. The clerk seemed to be a bit disappointed. Boarding the aircraft was on time and flight attendants were very friendly and helpful with our hand luggage. My wife was carrying a musical instrument and nobody cared that it was quite bulky. Service on the first leg cannot be rated, as we both fell asleep before even take-off (it was 3:30 a.m.). Changing planes in Athens was okay, only the departure gate was anounced quite late. Then the flight to Munich was nice, flight attendants very friendly, breakfast was okay, beverage selection fine. All luggage arrived on time in Munich. I cannot remember any in-flight entertainment, as I was mostly sleeping, but on flights with duration less then 2,5 hours one does not need entertainment.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Istanbul to Athens. I made six different flights with Aegean Airlines and its subsidiary Olympic Airways in a mix of business/economy classes on Airbus A320 and Dash-8 planes. All left and arrived on time. The Aegean/Olympic staff both on the ground and in the air were polite and helpful. Meals, when they were served, were good. The planes were clean and comfortable. The lounge in Athens Airport had really good food and a selection of Greek wines.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  As a Gold Member I fly regularly with Aegean and can compliment the timeliness, friendliness and professionalism of staff. I have been flying regularly from London to Thessaloniki via Athens (approx. 16 flights a year). On this occasion I was more than disappointed. The flight was delayed (not the airlines fault) but the crew did not seem to be interested in the comfort of staff. On several occasions elderly passengers struggled to place their luggage in the overhead bin and received no assistance from crew who stood by and watched. I was surprised by this as I usually they always assist. Due to the delay in take off the connection time in Athens would be shorter than normal. At this point, as always, I was not worried as Aegean usually does a excellent job in handling connection flights. Upon arrival to Athens and once departing the plane the connection Ambassador was shouting for anyone going to Thessaloniki to hurry - very unwelcoming! To make it worse she then decided to start sprinting and was shouting at everyone you have to run! Run or you will not make it. Looking at my fellow passengers who were mostly elderly this was more than unacceptable. My partner as well, due to an injury could not keep up. I told the member of staff to calm down and take it slow but she kept shouting to run and hurry. At this point I decided to proceed on my own with my partner to the gate and we made it in plenty of time before boarding had even started. Never have I experienced such rude behavior and such unnecessary stress. As a connection ambassador she should have known that there was time and that we would have easily made it to the gate with time left to spare. Instead everyone was pushed to walk at a fast pace with people struggling and no one taking notice. Aegean needs to review this and ensure the ground staff offer a good connecting experience with staff making sure everyone reaches their next flight in comfort. Even with the bad experience I can only recommend the airline and all they have achieved but find it necessary to share all types of feedback.",yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"  Thessaloniki to Athens. We checked in just fine, gave our luggage in, went through security and arrived at the Aegean lounge within minutes. We had booked a separate seat for our son with the intention of using a car seat for him. When we showed out boarding passes to the nice lady that greeted us in the lounge we inquired about pre-boarding for families. She did not know anything about it and simple said that we would be boarding from the lounge area when an announcement is made. We also inquired about gate checking the stroller and receiving it for use at our connecting airport in Athens she did in fact state that we could take the elevator down to the bus which would take us to the aircraft for boarding and that there we could gate check the stroller to be given back to us when we arrive at the gate in Athens. When the time came we heard the announcement for boarding for our flight and as we gave our boarding passes to the same lady that greeted us on the way in, she scanned them, checked our passports and asked us to wait next to the door to take us to the elevator. After all passengers went through the door, we were asked to follow her to the elevator to find that there was a line there of approx. 6 passengers in wheel chairs waiting to use it. Also the bus that all other passengers boarded was waiting on us. At this point she asked if we could carry the child in hand to walk the stairs down to the bus, and she offered to carry the stroller down as well. Although I did appreciate the offer, this was not an ideal situation. When we got to the bus, I was holding our son, my wife was holding carry on luggage and I had to manage a folded stroller as well, all while standing in a moving bus. Perhaps if as they advertised had offered proper pre-boarding for families with young children these things could go a bit smoother. We arrived at the aircraft and gave the stroller to the person standing at the bottom of the stairs, to be returned to us when we arrived in Athens. Got on board the aircraft, started installing the car seat for my son, which thankfully did not take long. We were told by the staff on board that the child would have to be sitting on either mine or my wife's lap for take-off and landing and they provided us with a seat belt extension to use for this. As in a previous flight, I did not argue with the staff and complied. Lufthansa did not have any issues with the use of a car seat used during take-off and landing. In any case the safest place for a child under the age of 2, is securely fastened in a car seat with a 3 point harness. When we arrived at Athens and de-boarded, we asked for our car seat and they were searching for it, while the bus to take us to the terminal was waiting for us. Took them a few minutes, but they found it. One last thing that I would like to point out is the fact that the plane was late departing from Thessaloniki, and that we had a connecting flight from Athens which we barely made thanks this. The thing that made this situation even worse was the fact that the bus driver delivered us to a door all the way on the other end of the terminal were we had to go. ",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10," Munich to Thessaloniki. This was the first time we flew with our infant son and were really excited to be flying with Aegean as in the past we have had a very good experience with them. This time around though it was not so pleasant. We had booked three seats (all business) so that we could place a car seat on board for our 14 month old son. We expected to be boarding before all others in the plane thus having plenty of time to put our things away and to install the car seat in the seat and securing our son. This was not the case. When it came time to board they announced boarding for business class customers so a whole lot of people lined up in front of us - no pre-boarding for families was offered as advertised on their website. When we got into the jet-way we were greeted by an Aegean Airlines employee who asked us about the car seat being checked to the final destination. We explained that we had purchased a seat for this, he demanded to see 4 boarding passes. Yes - 4 boarding passes, one for me, one for my wife, one for my son, and one for the car seat. I remember thinking you have got to be kidding me. After a few minutes of explaining to him that we had purchased 3 seats and one was for an infant with the intention of using a car seat for safety and after he said he had to check with the staff on board we were allowed to board. All 3 of us (or 4 of us according to that employee). So at this point all other passengers were boarding, so I had to wait for the car seat install until all passengers were on board - not an ideal situation. Furthermore we were told that we could not use the car seat during take-off and landing and the child had to sit on either myself or my wife using a seat belt attachment which they provided. At this point I was really not in any mood to argue with anyone and I did as they requested. We had our son sitting on our lap for take-off and landing instead of him being safely secured in car seat with a 3-point harness. Let me point on that this was a connecting flight for us from NYC which we flew Lufthansa and they had no issues with our son sitting in his car seat safely secured, yet Aeagean Airlines employees thought it to be unsafe due to regulations.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,  I flew from London to Cairo via Athens. Once arrived in Cairo we found that one of our bags went missing. We filled in a report form and told we would be contacted shortly. We received no reply for the duration of 2 weeks at which point I went to their office on the 4th floor in Cairo airport to find out that the bag had arrived and was returned once again to Athens. We were never contacted or informed of its arrival. The lady I spoke to said she would contact Athens and request for it to be returned. 2 weeks later we still have no bag and the office in Cairo is saying they have received no reply from Athens. Absolute shambles. ,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,  Athens to Hamburg. Overall a very bad experience. We boarded the aircraft for the flight to Hamburg through a jetway and while taxiing they told us that there is a problem and we had to change aircraft. We were waiting inside the aircraft without any other information and about an hour later we were asked to deplane to a bus and then board another aircraft through a boarding ramp.  Aegean could have used a jetway to avoid this hassle and they should have better informed us about the expected delay. We arrived at Hamburg delayed by at least 2 hours and no apology throughout the flight. All staff behaved as if nothing had happened. My family missed their train connections and had to pay for new expensive tickets.,no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"  Stuttgart to Thessaloniki back in April 2018. I spend a lot of money to upgrade my economy ticket to a business ticket. On board welcome was ok but cool. My seat in 1A was okay, cabin was clean. The food on this day was not from Aegean, they give a plastic box with potato salad and other vegetables. I never upgraded my flight for 280 euros for the one way flight, it is a shame, is these are  taste of Greece?",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Larnaca to Athens. Everything was fine. The crew was very friendly, the food was Great. I like the luxury feeling that it gives you compared to other airlines performing the route from LCA to ATH. 'm very satisfied.The only thing that disappoints me is that the baggage maximum weight is 8kg and other airlines have it as 10kg.",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Being a gold member of star alliance and Miles & Bonus I have certain expectations from a company. Aegean is still a decent airline but the benefits for gold members are less and less and the motivation to remain a loyal customer is being decreased on a daily basis. The free vouchers for parking make no sense if you are parking the car for more than 24 hours as booking your parking through Athens Airport website is always cheaper even if you use the ""free coupons"". Buying a seat at the front of the aircraft is also obligatory for gold members with flights being extremely expensive especially during summer period. The seats behind the emergency exits (which are for free) are unbearable. Worse than with low cost companies.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Thessaloniki to Nuremberg . I'm very satisfied with Aegean Airlines onboard product. I've flown with them several times the last few months. Some facts that deserve mentioning are clean and modern cabin, confortable seats (even though i think those could be a little more comfortable but they are ok for short-haul flights), polite cabin crew that makes you feel welcome onboard, nice food and beverages and finally good ground services. I suggest flying this airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,  Heraklion to Toulouse. There was a slight delay because of air traffic but as a whole the flight was enjoyable and the staff was polite. The beverage I chose was an apple juice. I would really enjoy it if I could lean my seat back but the seat was locked in the upright position and it can get tough to stay in that position for three hours.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  I flew from London to Athens in July 2018 with 4 bags, paying extra for the service. Only 2 bags arrived. I made a report on arrival. The following day I was flying from Athens to Luxor via Cairo. I received an email after I had checked on for my flight that my bags had been found. As I had 2 hours before departure I had time to go and reclaim them. I went downstairs and was shown a store room, my bags were there however one of them a 33kg bag I had paid for was ripped and was not in any condition to make any extra journeys. At the desk I was offered that they could replace the one big broken bag with 2 smaller ones. I accepted and I took one of the bags to Egyptair and checked it on whilst leaving the other with their supervisors to check in so I didn’t have to pay a fine for an extra bag. This bag was left in with them to send on the same flights and meet me in Luxor. The bag didn’t arrive plus I didn’t have any ticket for the bags to trace. I started the very very long and painful process of trying to find my bag via email. This was 7 weeks ago. Every week I get the same generic email that says they are at my disposal and want to help. Finally yesterday I had an email telling me to go to Luxor airport and get my bags proving me with ticket references. I arrive at Luxor airport only to find they have provided the ticket of the bags from London to Athens which are shown as claimed. But their email states this are from Athens to Luxor. This is the most ridiculous situation I’ve ever encountered. How can an airline lose your bags twice and provide ticket numbers from previous flights.",no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Barcelona to Cairo via Athens. The trip is generally good, but I ordered a halal meal and I had booked the ticket for the sector Barcelona to Athens. On the flight to Cairo, the hostess gave me a regular meal and when I asked her she told me it is halal. But the meal has no proof that it is halal. I told her that the meal is not halal. She told me that my name does not exist on the list. I gave her a booking ticket, and after I made sure my name was on the list. She told me that have not more halal meal.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Flying with my wife on 5th October 2017 from Madrid Terminal 2 to ATH. At check in the Spanish ground staff was polite, but went to extra lengths to explain the carry on luggage policy and insisted on checking in everything at no extra cost. Had fragile items that wanted on us, below the 8kg weight rule. Eventually, they let us carry our entitlement! At the Terminal 2 gate, there was a delay of approximately 15-20 minutes. Boarding was fine, and staff did not weigh any carry on luggage. Once on the aircraft, seats and cabin were clean. Lunch and the traditional Greek dessert from Rhodes offered was excellent! Were quite tired so did not use the inflight entertainment system. Overall, an excellent flight with excellent inflight service. I do not award full stars because of the luggage policy and the delay at Barajas Terminal 2 .",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Terrible customer service at Heathrow check-in and boarding gate. There was no Aegean Airlines staff to assist passengers. The staff at check-in and at the gate appeared to be untrained or poorly trained, and two of them were rude, abrupt, and unwilling to help me with a simple issue about my baggage excess weight with one stating to leave me behind if I did not reduce the excess weight and the other at the gate, forced me to check in my quite small cabin bag in which I had my laptop, hard drive and other equipment.",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  London to Athens. After scanning my boarding pass the ground staff asked me to weigh my carry-on bag, found that it weighed 10.5 kg :  2.5 kg above the permitted 8 kg per passenger and asked me to pay GBP 70 because  they needed to check my bag in as overweight. When I protested and said that I would transfer some items to my children's carry-ons in order to reduce the weight to 8kg, the ground staff threatened to weigh all our carry-ons / hand luggage and shopping to verify that they met the 8 + 3kg limit per person.  It is disappointing to experience such behaviour with my national airline which I have been using loyally for over 15 years. If an airline wishes to verify carry-on weights, then they should apply its checks across the board and not pick passengers arbitrarily. I bought almost 4 months in advance a round-trip ticket from Athens to London including a checked in suitcase for EUR 528 including taxes, and ended up paying Aegean EUR 608.  A final point I would like to make is that using SAS as ground staff to represent Aegean Airlines at LHR that seriously damage its reputation - irreparably in my case. ",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,  Prague to Kefalonia via Athens. A solid performance from Aegean. We always manage to find great pricing. Staff on board  very pleasant and well groomed. Food is lovely and in economy class hot meals are served. Flights punctual in our case. Two areas of improvement needed. One is Wi Fi and in flight entertainment. In flight magazine is the best. ,yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Athens to Brussels. I arrived there for my flight to Brussels with a big suitcase that contained a bicycle. The staff charged me a plus from 50 euro (I already paid a ticket for that suitcase and brought it to Greece with an identical ticket). So i paid for the suitcase in total 90 euro to get it to Belgium. I think they overcharged me this time, on the site is shows a 50 euro charge. They don't talk English on a level that they can solve problems. They don't take payments with Maestro, so I had to search for an ITM to get the money they charged me. ",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  We traveled economy class from Athens to Marseilles France on July 11, 2018. We were very impressed with Aegean, from ticketing, to boarding, to the food and drinks. We are United million milers, and were very pleased to have been able to check in in the Business Class line and for our luggage to be given priority. The flight attendants were super awesome, and not at all surly like American flight attendants. Very pleasant, nice cabin crew. They were very sweet to our kids as well. The food was delicious. But please Aegean, can’t you provide some entertainment? At least allow for free wi-fi for entertainment or even wi-fi for purchase.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Madrid to Athens. Although Aegean only operates short haul flights, the feeling is they would have what it takes to handle longer routes. The aircraft was tidy, well maintained and even smelled good. Crew attentive, perfectly groomed and extremely nice. Aegean serves hot meals  in economy class - with a choice between meat and pasta, even in a 3 hours short haul flight, and it tasted fairly good. Chocolates and mints after the meal were a nice touch. Seats in line with  European flights (cramped), on-time takeoff and on-time landing. Would  recommend and will fly them again to get to Greece.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  I Would like to give the flight between Athens - Copenhagen on July 16 2018, 100 stars if I could. This is about My son who was on the flight yesterday. He is so scared of flying and suffers from claustrophobia and panic attacks. He was sending Me text messages when they were boarding telling Me That he is getting a panic attack and wants to get off the plane. I told him to talk to the flight attendents so That they can calm him down. And they did!  After he got off the plane on Copenhagen, he called Me. Telling Me about the fantastic service from all your flight attendants.They checked on him the whole flight. Gave him water, food etc. Made sure he was ok. Please let the flight attendants get this message. You were fantastic. Thank you so Much. My son Will only fly with Aegean airlines from now on. Best service ever!",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Had a very comfortable flight from Heraklion to Zurich. I experienced a friendly and professional cabin crew and they served excellent food for an economy class flight. Unfortunately, there were no monitors at all in the airplane. A map which tells me where the airplane is, is all in-flight-entertainment I would need.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10," On holiday with my wife. An evening direct flight from ATH to MAD with Aegean Airlines. Check in was efficient and quite speedy. Was a problem when the departure gate changed about 20 minutes before departure time and was not easy to find due to works at the departure area at ATH. After we got there, there was a further delay of approximately 30 minutes, which eventually most of it was covered by the pilot and arrived at Barajas T2 only about 10 minutes late. Onboard, service was good - staff were polite, food was very good and inflight entertainment was satisfactory. Also, cabin was clean. I do not award ""full marks"" due to all these luggage restrictions, which have become entrenched in the majority of world's airlines but especially european ones.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Zurich to Heraklion return. Hats off to Aegean Airlines! My wife and I have been flying to Crete each summer for the last eight years. In the past we have flown with a Swiss charter air line. Which was a pain in the butt, for we had to travel when they did, not when we wanted! This time we went with Aegean Check in at Zurich was just outstanding, AAS did their best to move things along even with a long line, done in less than 20 minutes. This was a late night flight, It left on time, and the in flight service was one of the best that I have experienced in a long time. The only interesting comment I can make about the flight down, was the landing, let's just say it was a copilot landing. The best part of the trip was the return flight. Those of us who have traveled to Heraklion, know that the airport is a pit of pain and agony. I will address this issue, in a separate review,for things have changed. With Aegean they have there own separate check in counter, and a self check in, away from the madding charter craziness. Checkin was completed in 10 minutes! This was just fantastic! Where in the past it took hours! Ther was only a slight delay in takeoff due to weather/air traffic in Zurich, in flight service was outstanding again. After 14 years of long haul air travel for work, I have to give Aegean four stars in respect of outstanding service!",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,  London to Athens. I pay £16 to sit in a seat at the front that has a curtain right in front of me. Then there was no space for my luggage so it’s down the back which means I have to wait for the plane to empty before I can get it although business class empty cabinets. I am a silver member and the supposed 2 free ticket upgrades have never been available.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Mykonos to Athens. Check in smooth and easy - decided to print my boarding pass, as my mobile phone battery was dying. No paper on the e-check in machines, so had to use the desk, but this was quick and easy. Security in Mykonos airport was a breeze. Not enough seating on the gate. Aircraft arrived on time and was prepared for departure at a record time. Boarding was easy, both from the front and back - we just had to walk to it. Also quick and smooth. Full flight. They had asked some people to give their hand luggage for storage, so there was enough space on the cabin. Initially we were told that due to heavy traffic in Athens we'd have to wait 35', however better assignment was requested by the captain and we left just with 10' delay. Crew very professional. We were offered a greek local snack in this very short flight 25'). Landing on time. It was a pleasant flight.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Jeddah to Athens. The seating is economy with the center seat blocked. There is no entertainment system. No coat chef, amenity bag or blanket. There were pillows and newspapers. The single attendant for business class was not available. The window blinds in the cabin were not closed so when the sun rose the cabin was flooded with light. The product is terrible. This is a 3.45 am departure (3hr 30min flight) and there are no services to accommodate night flight passengers. Turkish flies a similar route and is markedly superior product.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Chania return. Was pleasantly surprised by Aegean having no idea what they would be like.  It’s only a short flight but each flight was on time, boarding started when it said it would, crew are very friendly and efficient. Would definitely fly again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Who knew that this airline was so great! On a short 30 minute flight from Athens to Santorini you still get served mints and a snack. New planes with generous seating I would definitely fly Aegean again. Certainly worth the few extra bucks for great service and comfort. Not 5 stars as Santorini airport is a disaster and although Aegean doesn't own it, would love to see them put pressure on investing in its infrastructure.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10," This review is about my recent trip with a friend from Athens (ATH) to Tel Aviv in the Aegean business class. 1) Athens airport: The airport in Athens has several lounges. Having a Star Alliance Gold card, we checked-out the Lufthansa lounge in the Schengen area before we made our way to the Aegean Lounge in the Non-Schengen area. Both lounges are above standard, but the Aegean lounge is better and we especially enjoyed the smoothies and sweets. Considering it is the flagship lounge of Aegean at their main hub, I wonder why it does not have shower facilities and an area to relax/sleep. On the other hand Aegean focusses on short- and medium-haul flights and does not find it necessary. 2) Seat: It would be great if Aegean would have a real business class chair. But like most – if not all – European airlines the business class had regular economy class seats with the middle seat being blocked by a table. The armrests could be moved sideways so the seat was wider. The seats in the first row offer enough legspace – only the emergency exit row in economy class has more legspace. There were no power outlets in the seat. 3) Onboard product: We found it nice that we were given menu and a wine carte. In addition to the meals offered onboard, business class passengers can pre-order other local dishes as well as special meals. I pre-ordered the Moussaka and it was really good. The airplane had overhead monitors were a film about Greece was shown. No WiFi and no personal device entertainment. 4) Verdict: Aegean offers a very good business class product compared to other European airlines. Seats should have power outlets. We were on vacation so power outlets and wifi were not that important to us. The onboard service is above standard and that is what was important to us.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,  Great service from check in to landing. Check in agent was very polite. The boarding was Excellent. The food onboard was delicious and tasty. The cabin crew was kind too.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Munich to Athens. We travelled in economy class in a tariff that includes luggage. Aegean is a member of Star Alliance, my friend holds an Aegean Gold Status and I am a United 1K. That gave us some advantages such as using the business class check-in, fast lane security and lounge access. The check-in in Munich is handled by Lufthansa and the agents were nice and professional. We used the business class counter and did not have a lot of wait time. Lufthansa lounges in Munich are good. Seat: Aegean sells seats in the emergency exit row, I find it disappointing that these are not offered for free to Aegeans/Star Alliance gold customers at the time of booking or at check-in.  The airplane was full and we had seats (aisle and middle) in the back of the plane. The seat spacing was comparatively very small. Onboard service: Even in economy, we were offered a full meal. Aegean offers a good selection of wines and soft drinks. The crew was very friendly. Aegean offers very good onboard service but the legspace was horrible. That is why I am subtracting three points. We had redeemed Upgrade Vouchers and were on the waiting list. Although seats were empty in Business Class (and up for sale), these were not released before take-off. Too bad.",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  Manchester to Skiathos via Athens to fly in June 2018. A text from them told me they cancelled our flights due to 'Operational Requirements' 6 weeks before our holiday and to ring them. They offered night flights several days later or to travel 5.5 hours to fly from Heathrow. Work, Pre-booked Trains. hotels and ferries meant we had to travel on that day from Manchester as Heathrow was £300 more for us to get there at short notice. At no point were they going to meet extra travel costs or compensate the 4 of us in any way other than refund our flights which we have had to do. Why they didn't provide a coach to transport people from Manchester - Heathrow I don't know and the unsympathetic attitude to our prearranged details astounded us. The result is we are flying with an alternative airline at a cost of £500 more per couple. Customer Services are next to useless and online only as there's nobody you can talk to in person. I'm still awaiting my refund which they say will take 10-15 working days. Today it's come to our attention that they're operating a flight out of Manchester on the morning our flight was due to depart via Brussels which would get us to Athens at a similar time to what we should have arrived. Upon bringing this to their attention and asking why we weren't offered this option they say they use Aegean Flights only in these situations. The first leg was operated by Brussels Airlines and the second part being Aegean themselves. They sell the flights, there was room on the flights yet we were not offered the option of them even though it would've been the easy alternative. It's the last time we'll fly with them.  They keep telling me all carriers modify flights and can change but this is the first time it's happened in my lifetime. ",no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,  Madrid to Athens. I booked the flight through skyscanner then made final booking through tripsta. There was no option there to choose or pay for sporting equipment (travelling with a bicycle) so I paid for checked in luggage 23kgs. At the check-in I was told I have to pay 50 euros for the bike. I asked if i could pay the difference as I did not know about their luggage policy when I was booking the ticket. I was told they were not responsible for their middlemen (here tripsta). The staff was not helpful. At the end they even checked my hand luggage as it was 11 kgs. I could have put those extra 3 kgs in the bike as bikes don't have a weight restriction according to Aegean Airlines website. Very bad service and lots of unnecessary hassle. I spent over half an hour making the payment at the till. Had to pay cash as the terminal was not working.,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,  Larnaca to Tel Aviv. This is the second time I was to fly Aegean Airlines. This time I bought tickets to fly in August 2018 in high price for comfortable flying hours since I am flying with young children. I found out the company cancel our flight and listing us to the uncomfortable flight time with no compensation.  I will not fly Aegean Airlines again.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Hamburg to Athens. Aegean Airline is one of the best airlines in Europe. The staff is very friendly and helps, if you have any questions or problems. The airplane was clean and in a very good condition. The food in the Business Class was very tasty. The variety of drinks is also very good. Everyone, who fly to Greece, must try Aegean Airlines!",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Flew from Tel Aviv to Thessaloniki, and I must say that I was completely satisfied with my flight. The food was great, the staff was excellent, and super polite (as usual) and the plane was clean and on time. The only small issues were that the seats were just a little bit uncomfortable for a two and half hour flight (they were too thin to be precise), the legroom was a bit tight, and there was no inflight entertainment. Other than that, the flight was fantastic! I can't wait for Aegean to start flying long-haul, as I would definitely fly with them on those long routes!",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Athens to Zurich. What has started as an excellent airline has slowly degraded to an airline with amenities  as good as those from a premium low cost. On the other hand crew is always welcoming and well trained. The airline is using bus-transport from the flight out from Athens to Zurich. It is unacceptable the least for the price paid at around 250 to 300 per person. Food quality has  deteriorated over the years, what used to be eggs and bacon became a low quality half piece cheese pie? Also a new policy to pay for front row seats during online checkin. My seat was slightly broken, but leg room more than sufficient.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Athens to Bucharest. Waiting in the bus (15-20min) to get to the plane, the flight was less than half full and they wanted to wait for all passengers in order to use only 1 bus. They had the old inflight magazine. Recently Aegean changed their policy and started charging seat selection up to row 14.  As a result, the second half of the plane was packed and the front was empty. Crew did not allow passengers to move to front seats. Snacks must be the worst ever.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10, London to Athens. I was at Heathrow and I had a carry-on baggage well below the required dimensions. Many people with bigger baggage were boarding without weighing them but then a rude gate agent weighed mine and found it heavier by 1kg and demanded in a very bad way to either pay a huge surcharge or be left at the airport! I found that unreasonable but I proposed to take out something if that was the case. They did not let me do that and strictly asked for my credit card to charge me or else deny me boarding the aircraft. I regret my choice to fly for the first time with Aegean. I will never fly with them again and the same will also happen with many other passengers of that flight that have been disturbed by the unacceptable behavior and offensive attitude.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Rome to Thessaloniki via Athens. A very good experience! The handling was nice. We had only a delay because of bad weather condition in Rome. The cabin crew was very polite and helpful. The food was nice, any snack and drink was made by top brands. I would definitely recommend to fly with Aegean Airlines.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"  Athens to Naples. Departure with some delay. Crowd at the gate. DHC8 are not the most comfortable planes to fly with. Narrow and hard seats, very cramped. In the particular one couldn't even fit my cabin baggage on the space above my head. On return, fare prices are noticeably cheaper than on jet aircraft. Crew served cold snack as there are no kitchen facilities on this aircraft.",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Rome to Athens. Flight was almost full, but departed almost on time. Ground crew offered to check in our baggage for free. Crew served hot small meal, good taste and choice. Even with full cabin they managed to serve coffee before landing preparation take place. Great service overall.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10," Very reliable and definitely positive experience with all aspects from check in to flight. I flew Berlin Tegel to Athens on an A320. Check in with Aegean Airlines at Berlin Airport was pretty fast. Berlin Tegel is one of the of the most mediocre airports but Aegean check in was fully manned / all seats full with check in staff. Fast check in / very kind personnel. Flight was almost 100% full. Crew were always with a smile and this was a full flight with lots of kids. All in all it felt efficient and hospitable. Food was hot, I ordered for free a Low Fat meal during booking, I think this must be the only airline in Europe still serving hot food + special meals for free in Economy. You can pick any meal during booking through their site. Bread also served, refreshments or wine, coffee, juice etc. Crew were always smiling. Normal economy seat size is very decent. They offer the option of paying to get a ""front seat"" with extra leg room. I have done it in the past and it was worth the 15-20 euros needed. This time I went for a simple seat at the rear of the aircraft, space was decent. I would not complain really, this is a very competitive fare price. If you feel you'll need some more extra space do go for the seat upgrade option for a few extra bucks. Nevertheless for the price / seat combination I was more than happy and ok with my seat size. Flight left on time, maybe 5 minutes late, arrived earlier. All in all a good uneventful flight with good service. No in-flight entertainment but good food / good in-flight crew service without a doubt. Do get some episodes of what you like downloaded onto a cellphone or tablet before hand and problem solved. All in all I would pick Aegean Airlines again based on the efficiency, accuracy of flight time and good fare when you book early / very good crew. Positive flight experience at a time when most European carriers are offering way less than them.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Copenhagen to Athens. We are flying Aegean Airlines every time we visit Greece, and are very happy with the flights, the crew and the catering. But, something went wrong at our latest trip  on March 29th: no coffee was served at all after the meal! We just wonder why? The catering has been perfect all previous flights. Just curious to know the reason. We strongly recommend Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  I had already seen online that the incoming flight from Thessaloniki was coming into Frankfurt with a delay of about 2 hours in December 2017, but there was no announcement regarding my flight from Frankfurt to Athens, either on the Frankfurt airport or the Aegean Airlines website regarding a delay. I called the call center and I was told that they had no update on that flight and to try to call the Frankfurt office who had no update and  the delay of the incoming flight does not mean a delay of my departure, as there might be another aircraft for my flight.  When I went to the airport, it was announced that there  is a delay of 2 hours. We ended up leaving with about a 3 hours delay, during which we were not offered anything and the counter was closed and nobody there. I had to kill 3 hours in Frankfurt airport which I could have avoided. The airline failed to inform me. Other than that the flight was full and the level of service pretty much of the high standard of this airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10," I experienced very poor service on the delayed flight from Athens to Heraklion on the 17th of March 2018. I was at the airport for more than 24 hours, very tired and anxious after traveling for a week in Germany. After the trip I also contacted customer care to express my complaints and they also had the same cold attitude that they did at the airport.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Bucharest. I enjoyed a lot my Business Class flight. Even for such a short flight (about 1,5h) the lunch was complete, including appetizer, main course and dessert. We were also offered hot towels which were very refreshing. The cabin crew was discreetly checking if we need anything, making you feel well. It's definitely worth it to upgrade!",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Athens to Dusseldorf. I travel frequently with Aegean and this flight was really nice. The cabin crew was really friendly and helpful. The whole flight from Athens to Dusseldorf was really flawless. The landing was perfect. We didn't even understand that we had landed (there was not even a short tremble when the wheels touched the ρθνςαυ). I definitely recommend Aegean Airlines.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Larnaca to London via Athens. They have wonderful cabin staff and are helpful, there with a smile. The food on board is very good as is the service, even though my flight stops over in Athens rather than direct, its still enjoyable. Only problem I had was first time at ATthens, when you are in transit its not clear where to go when you enter the airport . Apart from that can't fault anything keep up the good work.",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Cairo to Athens. Cairo airport boarding, everyone just went through long line up to board. As it was a 10.30 am flight breakfast was served,  a shriveled up omelet and two small pieces of smoked turkey,  a fruit salad with cottage cheese. Bread roll and croissant as well. The poorest breakfast I have been served on a flight in business class. I find it very strange that the food they served out of Cairo did not reflect Greek wonderful cuisine. I might as well have travelled economy would have better in the long run. I am not impressed with Aegean you need to review your catering.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Istanbul to Amsterdam via Athens. First flight of was operated by Olympic Air. The plane was a DHC-8-400. There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. After take-off, the cabin crew started the snack/drink service. Everyone got a cheese/beacon sandwich, but I am a vegetarian so I asked them if they had a vegetarian sandwich. They had vegetarian sandwiches and I got  2 drinks with the sandwich. From Athens, I took my next plane towards Amsterdam. This flight was operated by Aegean itself and the plane was an A321. There was enough legroom and the seats were comfortable. 30 minutes after take-off, the cabin crew started to serve meal and drinks to everyone onboard. Sadly, they didn't had a vegetarian option. But beside the meal itself everything was tasty. After I finished the meal I have slept till our descent towards Amsterdam. We arrived safely at Amsterdam. All-in-all I give both flights together a 9/10. I can recommend this airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  London to Athens. Excellent experience, boarding was efficient and organized, clean aircraft with welcoming friendly crew. After take off, drinks served, cleared, hot meal served in economy (simple but good, hot pasta, eggplant salad, warm bread with cheese and butter, cookie) coffee and tea trolley passed twice. Flight landed 45 minutes early, priority bags came off first 15 minutes after landing. Impressive experience.",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10," Flew Aegean Airlines from Athens to Larnaca. I have always wondered how such an airline that ever so often avoids jetsteps at airports, especially on this route going and/or coming can be honoured with a title. Yes, cabin staff are very professional, aircraft is clean, spacious. Yet, once again on our flight 912 / 9.2.18 arriving at 12.20 at a half empty LCA airport, the plane parked once again away from the terminal probably to avoid paying for jetsteps, and in use the good old romantic bus just like in the 50s. Inflight we were given a tasteless piece of bread which the hostess described as cheese pie, probably without any cheese inside. For my return flight all was fine, though the snack again was below expectations. Coffee however was very good.",no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Athens to Zurich. The flight was on time and the cabin crew was friendly and professional. The plane looked dated and worn inside and the seats were not that comfortable, IFE was nonexistent. But the friendly cabin Crew compensated for that. It was a 2.5 hour flight and they served a real hot meal. The food was OK, but hey, not  many airlines serve hot meals on intra-european flights these days. Communication between the flight deck and passengers almost nonexistent.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Aegean Airlines have updated their charges for sporting equipment, skis in particular. The first set of skis used to be free with the purchased ticket, but from now on it costs 50 euros per trip. I consider these charges ridiculous, this is something I would expect from Ryanair or a similar low budget airline.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew to Beirut from Sofia via Athens. All I can say that I was impressed by what this airline offers. Amazing and professional cabin staff, both flights were pleasant and everything was on point. The food they served was also much better than others can serve during flight. I won’t hesitate flying with Aegean again. I love this airline!",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Athens to Larnaca was a regular though very bumpy flight due to exceptionally bad weather at Larnaca, in flight staff is as always on this airline very professional, fine aircraft and  tasteless pasta on this route. Nothing to complain about and to my surprise on this route jet steps were used, something not so common on this airline. On our return flight on 23/1 under heavy rain and low temps the bus was used, plane was parked away from jetsteps and we were watching passengers trying hard to go down the stairs under the rain and then walk to the bus. This is a good airline, however they need to show more respect to their passengers as far as the jet walkways are concerned, and as a regular flyer I find that this point is negative.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Vienna. Punctual take-off and landing, nice and friendly cabin Crew, even the meal was fine. Very low price ticket, still high quality Service, I do not like the branding of the airline. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10, The delay at Schiphol airport for flight A3617 from Amsterdam to Athens due to weather conditions is something acceptable. What is not acceptable is the delay from Aegean to inform us by sms messages about the departure time. Nobody informed us that I could ask for free meals and drinks and I didn't take most of the receipts. You did send sms messages about the delay but no messages about free meals/drinks. Compensation for a 4.50 euros receipt for meals/drinks for two persons doesn't seem right. At least you didn't accept the 5 euros extended parking time which was caused by the departure delay. The total amount of money (9.50 euros) is insignificant for a company like Aegean. It's not about the money but the overall terrible customer experience which will force me to use alternative airline companies for my journeys when I can. I pay for more expensive tickets because of the quality and the trust I have about Aegean Airlines. If you can't offer more than your competitors why I should fly only with Aegean and not find cheaper alternatives?,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10," I flew from Athens to London Heathrow in Business Class. I have flown with Aegean many times before, mostly in Business Class and their service has been consistently good. On this occasion though there were problems. Aegean offer 4 free seat upgrades to their Gold flyers and 2 upgrades to their Silver flyers. This means a lot of passengers flying Business class for ""free"". On my flight there were 16 passengers in C class, 50% of which were free upgrades. One FA only was assigned to this cabin and as a result the service was far below expectations. The FA could not provide the service required on time or at the level it should be. For example, drinks were coming very slowly and the starter and main were served at the same time which is very unusual for Aegean on this route. By the time I finished my starter, the main was too cold. Also, passengers in C class were putting their feet up on the back of the front seat with the FA allowing it without any sort of comment. Certainly not a good experience this time. I have flown many times with Aegean, I recommend them and I consider them one of the best airlines in Europe. However, if they want to take the extra step and get another star they need to sort out some small things like these upgrades. Maybe reduce them? Do they need them for Silver members? During busy times, their C cabin needs more than one staff to keep up with the workload. I will be flying with them again soon though.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10," There was fog at the destination airport and two or three flights before us, due to leave at 10.00 local time, were cancelled for this shuttle service. The screens never posted cancelled or delayed in any flight including ours two hours later. The screens only posted ""Gate open"". There were some weather announcements. In the end there was this: ""Flight so and so is cancelled. Click"". No information, no apologies (Aegean is by excellence the no excuses airline, have had other similar experience in the past) but worst of all, there was no info or any guidance as to what to do with our travel plans, our tickets, some sort of minimum empathy or a minor sample of the infamous Greek hospitality, Aegean claims to be the carrier of.",no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Frankfurt to Thessaloniki. I've recently traveled with Aegean airlines where I was forced to pay an extra fee for my carry on at my connecting airport in Frankfurt.  The staff was rude and spoke to me and some other passengers in a military like tone. I will never fly with Aegean airlines again. My ticket was with Lufthansa but the flight was operated by Aegean, and was told that there were Aegean regulations. A very disappointed frequent flyer.",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10," I've flew Aegean Airlines very recently and was really looking forward to it, since they won an award for best regional airline. I've flown in economy class from Prague to Athens in A320 and then continued to Larnaca on an A321. Seats were comfortable in both planes and leg room was ok, but A321 had better legroom. Food was distributed really quickly and it was alright, we had pasta on one flight and meatballs on the other one, plus a snack and a chocolate bar. Drinks were also good and there was a good selection of them. Flight crew were also friendly and both flights arrived a little bit early. There was only one problem and that was that check in had be done by yourself (I do it online anyway, but some people might have problems with it). Overall it was a good experience and I would fly with them again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"  No IFE on this flight from Paris to Athens.  Service okay, nice food, no on board sales. They apologize that they did not do sales due to turbulence. Departed late but arrive Athens on time. Cabin clean and friendly service.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," I flew Aegean Airlines from Athens to Stockholm Arlanda in December. The flight was full, so the ground staff asked us kindly if we'd like to check our luggage for free. Onboard, the plane was clean and modern. We were served a full breakfast, and the flight attendants came around a lot with rounds of drinks. I really like Aegean cabin crew because they are very kind, polite and helpful. We arrived in Stockholm 30 minutes earlier, where we collected our luggage from the carousel. The only thing I'd like to mention is that most of the time Aegean does not use the jetbridges in Athens airport, even when they are available, and the passengers have to go to the plane by bus. Overall an excellent experience and for me is the best carrier in Europe.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10," Athens to Corfu. My wife and me are flying Aegean since they started and we were always fans. We fly up to 10 times and sometimes more per year with them. Since about 2 years we see a decline of their customer service and friendliness on the ground but also on board. On our last flight after boarding the aircraft a stewardess asked us if one of our duty free bag has a bottle inside in the overhead compartment. Yes, we said - she said (without 'please') that we have to put that under our seat. The bottle of champagne was even in a carton. When the aricraft started the whole bag went to the neigbour behind and so on and we were facing turbulences and had to hold that bottle - the stewardess did not even looked at us after and was looking away when we left the aircraft saying good bye to other customers. The stewardess showed an extremly unrpofessional behaviour - not only playing police and when asked for the logic reason could not answer it. We never had to do that on Aegean or any other airline - and other passengers with bottles in duty free bags on this flight also not. Not only we had 3 suitcases damaged by their ground staff 2017 - and now this - it's getting a bit too much. They offered us a cheap repair which was nothing really - lucky we have a good insurance which replaced them. I hope this gets all better again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Sofia to Athens. We arrived 1h.30mins. before the flight and went straight to the business class check in desk (thanks to Star Alliance Gold Status). Then we went to Preslav Lounge, where we spent a decent amount of time. We arrived at the gate, there was no priority boarding. We boarded and took our seats in row 1. Even though the aircraft was not supposed to have a business class cabin, the first row was separated by a curtain. This was a pleasant surprise for me. The plane took off on time. Snacks and drinks were distributed to all passengers. Shortly after that, we began our descend into Athens airport. The total flight time was 1 hour. We landed on time and picked up our luggage. We were soon in Athens.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10," A3 803, Munich - Athens on Dec 18th, 11.00 was the final leg of a longer trip that started in India. Time to board Aegean flight 803 comes and the relevant announcement invites first the usual group of pax (handicapped, passengers with kids, Business class and Star alliance Gold members). As the plane was parked somewhere farther on the tarmac embarkation took place by bus. So these people were the first to get on the bus and wait, until we are all shovelled and squeezed like sardines for the rather long ride to the plane. Is there a point to make any announcement offering the privilege of priority to these people, who will eventually wait longer and be cramped in the same bus with everyone else? Is this a flattering picture for an airport and airlines bragging about their awards? I am not sure if this should listed be under Aegean airlines, Munich airport or Lufthansa.",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10," Frankfurt to Thessaloniki. The worst part is how they carry on about the luggage. The ticket just said that 2 pieces of hand luggage are allowed. However when I checked in I was told that my luggage does not fit the requirements and that I am not allowed to take airport shopping with me on board. In spite of repeated questions the woman at the gate would not say what the definition of a personal item and carry-on luggage is. There was one that wanted to ban me from boarding because I dared asked them questions or complain about the service, which other people were doing as well. I had a standard-size cabin suitcase and a small handbag. I was charged extra for this. In spite of paying extra for it, the bag was removed from me and I ended up travelling without my personal belongings. There was plenty of space under the front seat for my luggage so lack of space is not reason for this approach. Staff are generally unhelpful and take the attitude that customers have to do the work. There were people who after queuing for 30 mins to check in were told that they should have checked in prior on an e-machine. And staff who are supposed to assist with this were curt and unhelpful. The woman who was helping me started serving another customer in the midst of serving me. She then accused me that I was not entering a long sequence of numbers on the booking correctly. She was supposed to be helping me do this. An FA got angry because I asked for brown instead of white bread and I had to ask for wine twice. They said they had forgotten it.  When we reached the destination people with bags a lot larger than mine were getting off the aircraft. The flight costs  too much and you get treated like you are a nuisance.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Flew from Stockholm to Athens on Aegean Airlines. Had only cabin baggage so I went straight to the gate. The airplane was at the gate on time, but the boarding was a mess, ending up having a 20 min delay. The cabin was clean and modern. The crew was excellent, carrying out lots of rounds of services. The hot meal was nice and delicious. They also offered 3 rounds of drinks. The captain kept keeping us informed about the flight. Arrived in Athens with a 20 min delay. The only thing I would recommend is to install some sort of IFE apart from the overhead screens. I've flown Aegean a lot of times, and I would certainly choose them again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Rhodes to Rome via Athens. Excellent flights with 3/4 on time and one with twenty minutes of delay. FA's were professional with a smile and provided excellent service. Breakfast on the outbound flight and lunch on the inbound flight offered plus drinks of your choice. The tastes were excellent. Coffee and tea soon after provided. IFE system consisted of movies about Greek cities which was ok for that short flights. All in all, Aegean provided an excellent service and is always a pleasure to fly with.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,  London to Athens. My parents recently travelled with Aegean business class and I have used the service before. The service is superb and the staff well trained and very helpful. On behalf of my parents who are an old couple I congratulate the airline and staff for their support and professionalism with passengers who need help. The menu and wines from different regions of Greece deserve special recommendation. ,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to London Heathrow and then onwards to Miami with another airline booked in one ticket. Check in at Athens airport was a breeze and luggage sent directly to the final destination. Flight was full and on time outbound, about 90% full and about 30 minutes delayed inbound. Boarding was orderly and the management of hand luggage in the cabin was good (not too much). Special meal was requested and it was very nice. Good service of food and drinks, included in the ticket price. Friendly and cheerful crew. I have become a regular customer and is has been consistently good.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  London to Athens. Excellent service, I fly Aegean regularly and service has always been meeting the same standards. The consistency in delivering a very good service over time is becoming a guarantee and deserves praise. Extremely polite staff and great in flight service. Punctual departure and arrival. Always at the best airport gates.  On the negative side, the high ticket prices. Does the Athens to London route need larger aircraft or more flights per day?",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Larnaca. I did not have any baggage problem at all. Everyone has to download the Aegean app and make a miles and bonus account for special offers and upgrades! You can have all the information about your flight (gate,time etc) and your boarding pass in your hand. On the airplane now, cabin crew was kind and friendly, we departed on time from ATH. The food delicious and my seat very comfortable (7A).",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Amazing. One of my best trips from Berlin to Athens. Very friendly cabin crew. Nice, modern and clean cabin. The food was delicious. On time arrival and departure. I was curious about the P.A (pilot announcement) if they will inform us about the flight and so they did 3 times. Before take-off at cruising altitude and before landing. I am going to fly again and again with them.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10," I am Gold Member of their Miles&Bonus program and needed 4 legs to renew my Gold card for another 12 months. So I decided to fly Vienna to Heraklion via Athens and back. I used my upgrade vouchers for flying in C. And as always the flights were most pleasant. First of all their stewardesses are really top. They are friendly, competent, charming and well-presented. Seat pitch and recline are perfect - I spent all 4 legs in row 1 and slept ok on some of the routes. Food and beverages were decent. The lounge in ATH is OK - not as good as other Star Alliance lounges but at least the wine selection is pretty good.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Great experience from Krakow to Athens. Having flown mostly low-cost airlines, it was a great change to fly with Aegean. Despite the low ticket price the service was better than other major airlines I have flown with. Seats were comfortable, food was nice (had vegetarian option) and there were lots of drinks available. The cabin crew was really nice and helpful. Despite a slight delay with the departure, we landed on time in Athens. The only thing that was a bit annoying was that the queue for bag drop for people with printed boarding passes took longer than the one for people without them (I thought it was quite unusual) and I had to rush to the gate after checking my luggage. But all in all, amazing experience, would definitely recommend.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew Aegean Airlines from Bucharest to Toulouse via Athens. This is the second time in a few months that I have had superb value for money from this airline. All flights were on time - in yesterday's case, half an hour early. This airline must be one of the few in Europe which still gives you something decent to eat and a glass of wine in the afternoon. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. However, what really impressed me was the space between seats. All flights have been a very comfortable experience and excellent value for money.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Helsinki. I've travelled with Aegean Airlines many times in the past few years. I decided to finally write a review, seeing the consistency of service - a single positive or negative experience can be attributed to chance, but I think safer conclusions can be drawn after having the same experience time after time after time. And my experience of Aegean Airlines has always been stellar. The plane was clean, in good condition (this time I flew with one of their new A320ceo - those with ""sharklets"" at the wing tips), inspiring reliability. The crew were friendly in a genuine way - it's amazing how easy it is to spot fake smiles - and gave the impression they truly care for the passengers. Leg room must be among the best, I've never felt squeezed in an Aegean plane. In-flight service is miles ahead of anyone else. You get a warm meal with drinks (including alcoholic ones, such as wine or beer), coffee/tea, before-take-off candy, and there were even gifts for children.  I'm baffled by some people who claim Aegean's in-flight entertainment is lacking, and I applaud Aegean's decision to show instead a truly beautiful video displaying the many places worth visiting in Greece. Flight-deck crew provide information to the passengers along the way.  All in all, it's hard to find any flaws. If I absolutely had to pick something, I'd say that sometimes the aisle seems a bit clogged - probably as a result of the cabin crew being busy serving passengers. I think Aegean fully deserves its ""best regional airline"" designation, as you get a lot of value for your money. Their prices are more than reasonable, and when you realize how much you get for what you pay, the result is totally worth it. No chance I'd fly with anyone else on my way to/from Greece",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Heraklion to Dusseldorf via Athens. For an intraeuropean flight it was a superb experience. After boarding a welcome drink was served on a domestic Greek flight, on international flight the menu was also handed over. After take off hot towels was given and a new round of drinks was served. The meal service is fantastic, you got a cold first course (grilled vegetables, two sorts of cheese, bread and butter, salty crackers), a second course (I could choose between a veal filet or rooster ragout in tomato sauce with local, greek pasta), I went for the veal, a little bit well done, but ok, it is reheated in an aircraft oven. The quantity was more than ok. After the main course you receive a selection of typical greek desserts. A great red wine was served (Orgion 2014). After the dessert I had an Espresso (Illy). Shortly before landing we had a second round of hot towels. The crew was outstanding and incredibly friendly and polite.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Munich to Heraklion. A principally good airline. Warm food was served, IFE even on short routes, friendly crew, friendly ground staff. Everything okay, but the seats bring Aegean down. Just 30"" pitch. That's not economy, that's cattle class. The flight turned into torture. I don't understand why Aegean Airlines risk their image by ignoring such important fact.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"  Tirana to Athens. First time flying with this airline and for the most part I was very pleased with the services. The attendants were nice and we got sandwiches and drinks included on the flight. Boarding was on time and departed on time. What I did not like was the rude woman at the Tirana check in. I had to check my bag in and I didn’t understand what she said at first because it was so quiet so she had to repeat it, which made her even happier you can imagine. I understand if you are having a bad day, but honestly just do your job and plast a smile on your face if you have to. You work in customer service and are expected to be pleasant, not really rude.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10," Stockholm to Athens round trip with Aegean Airlines. I fly this airline at least 5 times a year for the last 5 years or so and it does not fail to meet my expectations (almost) every single time, be it travelling in economy or business class. This time both flight legs were of top quality, with delicious meals and very good service overall. The airplanes were clean and departures / arrivals were on time. It is always refreshing seeing people being genuinely happy in their work, and I hope that this will continue being the case with Aegean Airlines.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Mykonos to London via Athens. This was my first time flying with Aegean. My ticket said that the first sector would be operated by Olympic Air but that was not the case - it was on an Aegean aircraft. The first sector from JMK-ATH was very short (less than 30 minutes in the air) but the crew offered sweets before take off, then a hand wipe and a small snack. The transfer in ATH was only 40 minutes but there were ""transfer ambassadors"" to make this process go smoothly. The second sector from ATH-LHR was very busy but the service (from the immaculately groomed crew) was first class. There was an initial beverage service, followed by a meal/beverage service followed by hot drinks, the crew were working really hard and provided such a great service. Aegean provides a premium airline experience that is becoming hard to find in the European short-haul market.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Birmingham to Athens return. Main reason I used Aegean on this route is the direct flight during Summer time as Aegean doesn't fly the route during Winter and I usually fly Lufthansa, Swiss, Austrian or Turkish Airlines throughout the year. Really disappointed to realise that the airline I was once proud of has fallen behind the competition. The aircraft was late on departure both ways of my trip. The seats are too close to each other and too narrow (30 ins pitch as LH). The food was unacceptable for a Greek airline that represents the country with the best cuisine in the world, both ways of my journey exactly the same food and each time worse that the previous one.  Cabin crew professional but with attitude and poor training, Night flight and they left the lights on throughout the whole flight without dimming them, announcements were too loud and hasty (especially in English), asked for water twice and they forgot it both times. The  magazine torn from previous use. Lufthansa uses small plastic holders where they offer the magazine so it doesn't get spoiled by use. Finally inflight entertainment is absent. ",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  On my way from Prague to Tirana I choosed to fly with Aegean Airlines via Athens. Check in and boarding went smoothly and the full aircraft departed on time. The seating comfort was normal for this type of flight. To my surprise a small warm meal was served on this relatively short flight, something we seldom see on intra european flights which nowadays only is for sale. Hot and cold beverages were offered ´with a small cake. No inflight entertainment but the captain gave inflight info over the loudspeakers. Arrival on time and transfer to the terminal. I will not hesitate to book Aegean again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to London Heathrow. This is the best direct airline from the UK to Greece. Very good value fare and excellent on-board service with pre-flight sweets and during the journey, two rounds of drinks, tea/coffee separately and a hot meal. Clean A321 both ways. Flying into Heathrow was the usual stacking before the always amazing sightseeing aerial tour of London as the aircraft made its approach. I used to fly BA on this route but a large gulf has appeared in its service provision for the outer European routes: until BA substantially improves I will continue to fly Aegean from Heathrow.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Nurnberg to Thessaloniki. I almost solely fly Aegean Airlines because they offer Ryanair prices with a Lufthansa comfort and service. On medium haul flights they offer a complementary warm meal, unlike most European airlines. On short haul flights, they offer a snack and and a drink and a coffee. I´d like to add, that I once had my flight anulled due to bad weather, and they offered me a free 5* hotel stay, considering European law does not oblige airlines to offer such things due to bad weather. For me Aegean is Europe's best airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Flew Rhodes to Athens with Aegean. Cabin crew were rude and unfriendly as I don't speak Greek. Seat was dirty from the previous person on the previous flight. They didn't care, they just wanted to get everyone on board. No apologies. Used to love travelling with Aegean but their service has really gone downhill these last few months.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Thessaloniki to Munich. Excellent trip, on time and very good service. Business class is spacious, service friendly and thoughtful. Priority boarding and priority transfer from plane to terminal much appreciated. Good information on board, experienced pilots, smooth landing. Overall a very pleasant experience.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"  Athens to Lisbon. Perhaps due to tourist season, the ticket was expensive, more than 400 euros. All the seats on the plane full, several flight attendants are very diligent, which issued food, food was not delicious to me. The crew pushed the cart several times, for everyone to be served Drinks. The seat comfort was bad for me.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Paris to Kephalonia via Athens with Aegean. Aegean have restored my confidence in flying again. Everything from the airports to the flights was lovely, the seats on the plane were ample for my larger than average size and no seat belt extender was needed, the cabin crew and ground staff were very pleasant. Four flights and not one delay. Ok the food wasn't really to my taste but then we don't expect a gourmet meal on a plane. Loved the little TV screens plotting the course of the plane and all the information about the flight. Appreciated the announcements on the plane by crew in English but wish they spoke a little slower. Transfer was easy although a bit long on the return trip (+5 hours) and we were advised by message of which gates to go to. Would fly with them again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10," Excellent check in with freindly helpful staff at business desk.  Lounge (Swissport) used by Aegean for London flights is dirty and appalling, why the Aegean lounge cannot be used is beyond me. The furnishings are dirty, some graffiti on seats, no clean glasses, food looks miserable and the place strewn with dirty glasses and plates. This is our second visit to this awful lounge with Aegean business class, and it is time for them to either allow access to the advertised Aegean lounge on the website or change to a better serviced lounge, as for what we pay it is not a good image for Aegean airlines. Business class were not given priority over people in economy with children on this sector of flight. Never seen this before, but again not good enough. What is going on at Athens airport, this didn't happen in London. The attendents on the flight were excellent, but the food main course were really poor, not up to your usual standards. We fly with Aegean because they are better than the rest, they need to step up, standards are slipping. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Athens to Larnaca. When loading passengers on the bus to be transferred to the aircraft, the Gold members including business passengers should be transferred separately and not wait for the bus to be full with passengers because then it defeats the purpose. WiFI is not offered by from Aegean Airlines.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Athens to Brussels. The quality of the service is getting worse. I regularly pick this operator for my flights from Brussels to Athens and back. During my last trip not only we faced delay, but also the information provided was not accurate. They did not clearly communicate the reason of the delay and kept on stating that the flight will leave at 18.00 although it was 5 minutes later. ",no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"  London Heathrow to Athens. Food of very poor quality and small quantity for the glutein free option. Boarding experience from London Heathrow was unpleasant, since ground staff asked me to check in the hand luggage that was accepted for cabin when travelling from Athens. Do not understand how they are not standard rules.",no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Zurich to Athens. Good service, no doubt. Flight on time, they smile and was for me the first time that I did fly on this airline. A good Business Class service, not only the smiles. The food was great, a great plate of Fruits and vegetables, good wines also. Good value for money to be honest. I will be back for certain. And space in the compartments to put the our bags. I appreciate the fact that on the end of the flight they send a separate bus for the Business Class. Good experience and good service even on a short flight.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  I had a standby ticket for the flight Heraklion to Zurich and onward to final destination Frankfurt with another company. The connecting flight however was 55 minutes after arrival at Zurich. I would like to thank your ticketing/check-in staff to finding the perfect solution for me. I am very impressed by your team and will recommend Aegean Airlines to everyone. Hope to see you again soon.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  Frankfurt to Athens. I am very disappointed in the service of Aegean Airlines. On my flight to Athens from Frankfurt I had to pay an extra fee of 60 euros to check in my cabin bag exceeding the weight limit by 2kg. I was not the only one getting this treatment. Not that the bag would have been bigger in volume than the one allowed, only it wasn’t the correct form but would have still fit the overhead compartment just fine. Also a couple of people who had bought tax free products at the airport and now had to check in their bags because the extra plastic/paper bag they were carrying also had to be in their cabin bag . The service onboard was standard and the flight arrived on time, all of which I couldn’t enjoy after the experience I had at the gate. ",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,  Rome to Athens. I pre booked my seat. It was close to an emergency exit. However I did require a seat belt extender. Instead of the matter being dealt with discreetly the air hostess as loud as she could said she cannot allow me to sit there if I require an extender because it means I am not fit. No that's not the case. Regardless she then proceeded to as loudly as she could going to every person in rows behind me asking if they are alone and are willing to swop seats because I am too big to sit by the emergency exit. I have never been treated in such a disgraceful manner by an airline. To top it off I was skipped when food and drink was being offered. I will never travel this airline again.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Bucharest to Heraklion via Athens. Superb flight. First when we did the check in the person let us 2 baggages even if we didn't pay for them extra fee so it will be easier for us in the plane. They had great food on board and taking in consideration that we traveled with a 1 year and 2 months baby they gave us extra care. Great Company and I highly recommend it.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Aegean is definitely one of the best airlines in Europe - no surprise they keep winning awards. Top level service, excellent food on board, amazingly friendly staff, flights leave and arrive on time, they fly to the best airports (for example, London Heathrow instead of other lower-cost London airports) and they always park at the most convenient gate. Top choice for flying in Europe.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Another high quality experience with Aegean flying from Athens to Berlin. All staff were polite and highly professional, and free hot meals and alcoholic beverages were offered. A thunderstorm in Berlin required a diversion to Leipzig airport for several hours, followed by storm-related problems disembarking at TXL - all handled by the staff calmly, courteously, and with frequent updates - free refreshments were also available during the delay. Some sort of inflight entertainment would have been appreciated. Would be very interested in seeing this airline provide long-haul service.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Mytilene to London Heathrow via Athens return. As always, a pleasure to fly with Aegean. Cabin crew were very friendly, efficient and professional, plane was clean. Food was ok, it's not 5 star fine dining but much appreciated even on a 3.5 - 4 hr flight. Lovely wine. Landed early in ATH as is nearly always the case. ATH - MJT was a full flight and about 35 mins in the air with a drinks service followed by a breakfast snack service followed by coffee tea service (those cabin crew were constantly on the move and smiling). One thing that I'm not keen on is the pre allocated seating which is a pain especially if you want a specific seat (extra leg room, I'm 6' 6""). From LHR to ATH I logged on for check in as soon as it opened and there were only approx 13 other seats to select and from ATH to LHR approx 18 seats. Fortunately got an extra legroom seat on outbound but inbound had to ask an agent at the airport if a seat had become available. After a bit of tapping away she gave me extra legroom seats on both inbound flights (very appreciated). Please can we go back to selecting our own seats? Boarding is the usual chaos with no one taking any notice of the announcements (if they're boarding passengers seated at the back you can bet those with seats at the front will go through too) but it's no big deal and in no way reflects on the airline. Will definitely continue using Aegean when flying to Greece though",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Athens to Lemnos. I have flown Aegean many times over the years and never had an issue. However, our luggage was lost on a recent trip to Lemnos. It seems Aegean ground staff at Lemnos Airport were limited to the transparency of the situation. I will assume this part of the operation is outsourced or they have very poor communication skills or process in Athens baggage. The Aegean staff were extremely accommodating to my questions and follow ups - in actual fact, I did sympathise with them and the position they were in as there were others in a similar situation. The luggage did arrive, 72 hours later. In short, not a pleasant experience (not the lost luggage but the communication for both staff and customer). I would fly with Aegean again, provided their internal communications improve!",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew Zurich to Rhodes. I have never been disappointed by Aegean. Online check-in process is straight-forward, with just a few clicks whereas with several other airlines you have to go through more steps. The plane was delayed for 15 min because of traffic in Zurich but the captain and the crew were updating passengers constantly. Leg space was more than average. Food was good for such a short (and inexpensive) flight. But what makes the big difference in every flight is the crew. They go beyond the formal politeness of crew members and do not hesitate to show more of their human side. It is nice to see how they speak spontaneously to the passengers, make jokes, and are very caring and enthusiastic with children. Please, keep doing the great work and you will always have your loyal passengers.",yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"  London to Athens. Very poor performance by Aegean Airlines on 25 July. Delayed departure but arrived Athens 3 minutes late, hot cabin, rude staff while boarding.  I used to be a regular customer, but unless something changes I wouldn't recommend.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Again, a very nice experience with Aegean Airlines. I was flying from Warsaw to Santorini via Athens with a layover there. First flight was very nice, left almost on time. I have pre-ordered Halal meal for this flight and I must say it was one of the best meals I have ever had. Athens airport has got a bit better from last year, so it was easy to connect there and I was also able to get some sleep at the airport. Second flight was leaving at 5.15am, the boarding via a bus was a bit chaotic but managable, flight was very short and we also received a chocolate croissant. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Berlin to Athens. Aegean has been my preferred airline when traveling to and from Greece. The aircraft are new, clean, and have a lot of leg space. The staff are very friendly and the food and beverage are one of the top I have had in regional flights. Flight are time never causing me delays. Also the price is very good. An excellent airline and highly recommended.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Chania to Athens. Short flight of about an hour. Seat in 3-3 configuration with middle seat blocked out with tray. Business class cabin had just two rows. Comfortable seat with good leg space. A basket of lozenges was passed around and a newspaper (only in Greek language) offered. Boarding was a bit disorganized as we were made to wait outside the security hold area on the Tarmac side for a bus to take us to the aircraft less than 100 feet away. Once in the air, an open faced cold sandwich and drinks were served on a tray as also a hotel towel. The flight attendants were exceedingly efficient completing all the tasks in such a short period while changing their uniforms to suit specific roles - wearing cap and scarf while welcoming was on board, removing those and donning an apron to serve meals, and the again formally attired when we touched down. Flight announcements were frequent and clear in English and Greek. The view out of the window beautifully showed off the town of Chania and later on, the coasts and islands of Greece. On landing on time, long taxiing to a remote parking bay. A large bus - meant only for the business class passengers - whisked us away to the terminal. A very well done flight!",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Thessaloniki to Athens on a full aircraft on a very early morning flight. Flight on Olympic Air codes, but fully operated by and booked with Aegean. Everything went according to plan. Timely departure and arrival, orderly embarkation, not too much hand luggage in the cabin, courteous staff. The service included some biscuits and one drink for a 35 minutes flight. Choice of seat without charge. Very satisfied and much better than the low cost competition (Ryanair was the same price - but you have to think of all the add ons, the attempts to sell and the tricks).",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Manchester to Athens return. Delayed at Manchester on the way there but the time was made up. On the way back we were delayed at Athens, no information on how long we would be delayed before boarding. We were only made aware that we would be 1 hour late when the captain announced the arrival time later on in the flight. At no point was the delay acknowledged with an apology.",no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  Aegean Airlines is fairly new with a new fleet of A320´s. Service is generally good but unfortunately not an airline to let your kids travel alone with. I used their flight assistance service that guaranteed me that my unaccompanied girls would sit close to the the Flight Crew so they could look after them flying from Copenhagen to Athens. However, they were denied this and had to sit in the middle far away from the Flight Attendants. Even though I myself is a Gold Member it was not possible to get seat allocation in advance.",no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,  Santorini to Athens. The flight was very pleasant. The staff were friendly and helpful and the plane was clean and well maintained. A snack and drink was served which didn't matter since the flight was so short at 45 minutes. Also the fact there was no IFE didn't matter either.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Milan to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Staff are very friendly and the onboard service is good. Business class seats are the usual ones, that means 3 seats together having the midle seat empty.  For extra leg room, I suggest to book your seat in advance and choose the first row seats. You can book your seat in business class any time you like. Food was so so. Maybe they want to serve some Greek dishes but the result was not so tasteful. Some times I wish I had some steak with vegetables, instead of chicken cooked in various ways. Concerning the wines, they serve each month different wines from various areas of Greece. The red wine I tasted was from Cephalonia and it was excellent.
",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10," I have been using Aegean Airlines for long time now, being a frequent traveler with them the last 2 years and participating in their miles and bonus program. On my last flight from Frankfurt to Athens to my surprise I have noticed that the spacing of the seats has decreased. With such a small space my knees were in the back of the front seat all the time and with the passenger in front fully reclined I ended up actually standing the majority of the flight time. On the other hand the cabin crew is always pleasant and helpful, the coplimentary food and beverage is always above average and the aircraft are clean and new. I wouldn't like to see Aegean going down the path of budget low cost airlines but their seating lately seems it goes that way. I hope my next flight with them in July wont be as bad as this one.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Milano. I think that Aegean has a very good economy class product for short haul flights within Europe. Seat is quite comfortable and since you can book your seat 48hrs in advance using the echeckin services, you can select an emergency exit row free of charge. Lot of other airlines will charge you with 15 to 20 euros for such a seat. Then it is one of the few airlines which still serve a hot meal. For the flight between Athens to Milano other companies serve a cold sandwich. We have been served a hot breakfast plus yougurt with honey, juices and coffee. Plane departed with 15 minutes delay but we arrived on time",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Flew Aegean from Athens to London Heathrow. Flight departed on time. Fair quality of food. I had a low cholesterol breakfast consisted of omelete and grilled vegetables. All other passenger received a hot bread stuffed with cheese, so better to go for the low cholesterol meal. However do not ask for the fish meal, because it is awful. The plane was full however staff did everything they could to provide good service",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  We fly several times per year to Athens and the highlight of the journey is to fly Aegean. Perfect service and food onboard. Always a smile from the crew. We appreciate now especially the late return flight to Stockholm on Fridays. We also appreciate the high service level when in contact by phone. Short or no waiting time at all and perfect service. Only one proposal for a future improvement: the inflight announcements in English should be carried with no F1-speed but articulated so the message is understood! We have promoted Aegean to all our friends and family members, both in Sweden and Finland. And all have been very satisfied. Except for the above mentioned message issue. We strongly recommend Aegean. A Greek company to be proud of.

",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  
Flew Aegean Airlines from Athens to Copenhagen. Absolutely perfect. Nice staff and very friendly with us. A brand new and clean aircraft with very good inflight entertainment. Lastly the food was very good and tasteful but the ticket was a little bit expensive.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Munich to Athens. Very good experience in total. Food not the best but still fine. Friendly Cabin crew. Brand New aircraft.  A bit frustrated with the ""miles and bonus"" reward program. Very limited seats. Trying to book using my miles but there is no availability for 6 weeks in a row for a route with 3 flights a day. How is this possible? Also not very generous with miles. Most of the times I choose Aegean in order to collect miles but I can't use them. Don't waste even 10 minutes to apply for this as you will only collect miles and you won't be able to spend the dates you want. Only the very cheap flights are free and still have to pay the tax.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10, This is not the first time that I've flown on Aegean Airlines. Every time I've use this airline I was satisfied. This time however from Kalamata to Lyon it might be the best flight I ever taken. I did my check-in online which went fine. The check-in line up at Kalamata airport was fine the waiting was not very long. The flight was on time and even landed at Lyon earlier than scheduled. The only entertaiment was the airline's magazine. The cabin crew was probably the best that I ever experienced. The service was amazing with a tasty hot meal on a short flight. Also the flight attendants were nice and friendly and even went the extra mile by asking me if needed anything else. Overall Aegean airline is probably one of the best short haul airlines. I would not hesitate to fly back with them even if I need to make a connection into a different city.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Milan to Athens return. Another good flight with Aegean. Nice crew, regular information from the cockpit, A321 with very good legroom, good service on board. In Athens no airbridges (why?) Things to be improved: no IFE on board, food could be better. However I have no doubts: Aegean is the best option from Milan to Athens. If they continue to mantain this quality, I will use them again.
",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Great airline, only problem was the fact that we were late at least 10 minutes both ways, from Stockholm-Athens-Chania and back home to Stockholm. Had to wait in the aircraft for up to 30 minutes after we were supposed to takeoff. Seats were ok, did not expect anything better for an economy flight. TV showed short clips from all over Greece. But on the bright side, the food was the best airplane meal I have had. I ordered lacto-ovo-vegeratian and it was great. Tasted excellent. Just plain pasta, zucchini and cheese, and back home it was an omelette with cheese. Also my friends ""normal"" food was very good. We were served nice treats and drinks at appropriate times. Cabin crew were friendly, but their english could be improved, or at least talk a bit slower. You could barely hear what they were saying. For example when they explained why we were late, we only understood that it was something wrong with the aircraft.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Lisbon. Aegean Airlines has been the only way from Lisbon to Greece for the past year. Special meal as requested. Very friendly crew, eager to provide assistance to passengers. In flight info about the trip by the captains. Very comfortable and clean seats. No delays. If you book tickets in advance, you may find some really interesting offers. Can't wait for my next flight. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Larnaca to Budapest via Athens. Timing, transportation to the plane, boarding etc was all fine. Specially I was flying with a dog in cabin I was happy that I can manage it by Aegean Airlines. The crew members were very helpful and kind, the food was excellent. On the back way they changed the departure time of my flight from Larnaca to Athen. It started before 1.5 hours as in the original schedule. I received an e-mail before 16 hours the changed departure time. Unfortunately I was not able to read it due to an internet service error. So I just had a phone call before 40 minutes of departure - during I was still traveling on the Airport transfer bus to Larnaca - so I had no chance to be on time at the airport.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Athens to Istanbul in August 2016. I have flown Aegean over a dozen times over the past 3 years . I travel to Greece almost every year from Australia and one of the most enjoyable parts is the service from Aegean Airline cabin crew. I have been recently upgraded to Silver Aegean Miles + Bonus and have been given two complimentary business class upgrades that I will be using this year. I recommend Aegean Airlines to anyone who travels in and around Europe on routes offered by the Airline. ,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"  Istanbul to Athens. Departure on time. Crew very friendly and helpful. They served cold snack, drinks, coffee as well as Easter treats. However the DHC 8 propeler aircraft is noisy, narrow and somewhat inappropriate for international flights. Hope they replace it soon.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Barcelona to Athens. Due to the Easter season, all passengers were given chocolate Easter eggs. The flight was on time. The airplane was very clean, along with the bathroom. Hot towels with lavender scent were provided, and a welcome drink was given. The food was excellent. The seats were leather, and reclined well. The airline magazine was available to every passenger, while a tour of Greece and Cyprus played on overhead TV's. Inflight shopping was available. The crew spoke good English. One of the best flights I have even been on, and would certainly fly with Aegean Airlines again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Rome to Athens. Though a considerable short flight of 1.5 hours every effort from the staff to keep the tourists statisfied has been made providing a wide variety of newspapaers, beverages, etc. A really good info updating from the cockpit. I would use this again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Amsterdam return and both flights almost full. Aegean still maintains a lot of the elements of the full service concept, apart from the hold luggage, which is paid for. Punctual on the outward flight - the return flight was almost 1 hour delayed due to traffic and strong winds in AMS. Most flights at this airport were delayed. We had to wait a long time untli take off seated in the aircraft. You can request between many different meal options, and I requested the seafood one, which was great and also accompanied by a nice wine from the Peloponesse. Aegean consistenly has a much better level of service than most airlines. Will be happy to fly again!",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Milan to Cairo via Athens. I was pleasantly surprised by the service onboard on my short flights (approx. 2h each). It was my first flight with Aegean. Service was quick, began offering small candies. Food was tasty, although smaller portions, but sufficient for a short flight. Good selection of drinks. Friendly staff, aircraft was clean. Only one strange thing, by transfer in Athens. If you come from the non Schengen country and continue to the Schengen countries, you must leave the transit area to public area and pass again security control and through duty free shops. Generally I recommend to fly with Aegean. Why is Aegean only 3 star carrier? ",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,  Tel Aviv to Madrid via Athens. I give kudos to Aegean for having a specific section on their booking website for indicating the disability of a passenger but it is regrettable that they don't make better use of the information provided. My wife is blind and travels with a guide dog. While US airlines are very good at making accommodations for guide dogs our experience is that European airlines have less understanding of reasonable accommodation. I recognize that Aegean does not have a typical bulkhead that allows a little more space for an assistance dog and they did block out the center seat on both flights on check in but instead of providing a seat in the first few rows of coach we were placed in row 18 and row 19 on the legs between Tel Aviv and Athens and Athens and Madrid respectively. Being right in the center of the plane meant that it was necessary to negotiate a much longer stretch of the narrow center corridor for embarkation and disembarkation and much more difficult access to bathroom facilities. The odd thing was that after completing my reservation online I called Aegean and was specifically assured that we would be placed in the first row of coach class. Obviously a wasted call because when we got to the airport we were told they had no seats set aside for us and were even unsure if they would even be able to block out the center seat on the second leg. Aegean would do well to take some lessons from Delta or American on how to handle guide dogs. The other issue I had was that the plane was way to hot!! On both flights I asked if the temperature could be lowered. I was informed that the ends of the plane were maintained at 24 degrees C which meant that the center of the plane got much hotter and they would not lower the temperature to better serve the center because they would then get complaints about the plane being too cold. Whereas if the plane is too cold a person can add additional clothing but if the plane is too hot then if one is already down to shirt sleeves ther is not much else one can take off and remain decent. Obviously this is a serious design flaw with the equipment with the equipment that is used by Aegean but perhaps they should re-examine the cabin temperature they maintain so that people in the center of the plane don't have to endure excessive heat. The overall rating I am giving is for the issues discussed above. Without these two unfortunate circumstances my rating would be an 8 or 9!,yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"  Aegean used to be a good airline but in the last 2 years they have been adopting some low cost airline habits while keeping the fares quite high. Flight A3601 from London Heathrow to Athens. I was at the airport 3 hours before the flight but the business class check in was closed. Same thing happened again 2 months ago. I used the economy check in and after 20 minutes in the queue I was told by the airport staff that unfortunately Aegean pay to have their business class check in open for less time than all other airlines in T2 and so it would open later. Shocking! Aegean, if you can't afford to have business class check in open, do not sell business class tickets or do not fly to Heathrow. Also, when arrived in Athens, once again the A321 full with over 200 passengers and in the middle of a storm, parked at a remote stand rather than at an air bridge. This seems to be common practice for Aegean and the excuse that all air bridges are occupied is simply not true because on this occasion nearly all of them were free. Aegean are clearly cutting corners but their fares are still very high. Their level of service though has dropped significantly to the point that it will cost them passengers. At least they lost myself! Until I know that they have reached the levels they were at two years ago, I will be flying with other Star Alliance airlines only and unfortunately from now on I do not recommend Aegean.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Flew from Athens to Frankfurt. The aircrafts are new and clean. The crew always have a big smile and are ready to assist the passengers with any problem. The pilots are experienced and I always feel comfortable flying with Aegean. The food quality is excellent and the quantity is adequate. My first choice when I fly.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Hamburg to Athens. The flight was excellent, very punctual and the crew are really very friendly. I received an excellent service. A delicious meal was also offered. They offer everything for free including drinks. The crew care about you with a very warm smile.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Thessaloniki to Munich. It is the best airline I have flown and Aegean airlines respects each passeger. Flight only lasted two hours and the meal offered is not common in short flights operated by other airlines in Europe. Cabin crew is so nice. I recommend everyone to use this airline. ,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"  Athens to Larnaca. Cabin staff is always more than professional, aircraft though not so spacious looks immaculately clean and new, and usually there is no delay. In this case there was a half hour delay, no reason or apology was given. What they call breakfast was a cheese pie practically without any cheese, completely tasteless. Once again at destination this flight was parked away from terminal using the good old bus transport system. The excuse that all jetways were full, is more of a joke.",no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,  Vienna from Athens. At the gate we were offered the option of checking in our hand luggage at our own discretion which I like. The flight was almost full and was on time. The seat space is very tight considering it is not a low cost carrier compared to other airlines from the same group (Star Alliance) but for a two hour flight its tolerable. The cabin crew was polite with passengers but you could see some friction between some of stewardesses.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Amsterdam to Rhodes. It is a pleasure flying with Aegean Airlines. The crew is friendly and the service is one of those you rarely find. Aegean Airlines is a company with personality always behave its clients as it should, and I am always satisfied with its services. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Very pleasant flight from Berlin Tegel to Athens. Flight was a bit more expensive than the competition, but still cheap (47EUR for a one way ticket). It was really worth though, cause the flight time was much more civilized (11.15am). The flight was about 50% full, there was plenty of space and no issues with hand luggage. Departed and arrived on time. Ordered the kosher meal, which was really great in terms of both quality and quantity. Plenty of drinks (food and drinks are included in the price of the ticket). Choice of seat also for free, so I requested an emergency exit seat. All in all, a slightly more expensive flight than the low cost competition, but taken into account the ancillary included, the food and drinks, the convenience and the flight times, it was well worth the price. Keep on the good job!",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew Athens to Madrid. Aegean, in business or economy (most of my flights), is the best. Punctuality, cabin service, ground staff, call center, frequent flyer programme is excellent. I only regret that they principally fly A320 instead of A321. Cabin crew are pleasant and professional.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Frankfurt. Overall excellent experience. The flight was fully booked, but boarding was on time, fast and easy. The cabin crew was very friendly and helpful and the flight arrived on time. The only glitch is that one of my suitcases arrived broken, but that is the responsibility of the Frankfurt Airport staff and not the airline. Nonetheless, Aegean offered me a new suitcase for replacement for free.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Milan with Aegean Airlines. Excellent flying experience. Despite the flight being full (and overbooked, however they asked for volunteers to be booked on the next available flight, get compensation and a free ticket) they boarded everyone with small delay and landed us on time. Seat, I was on 2F, clean and very comfortable, featuring excellent legroom space. Staff smiling and very friendly. Meal was a great surprise. They offer a tasteful first and second course, with options and selections of traditional food from various regions in Greece. Wine list was also good. The dessert was a delicious cake served with greek yoghurt.
",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  I travelled  from Mytilini to Athens and it was one of the best flights I Have had, with a smooth landing. The seats were comfortable enough. Food was served, even though the flight was only 45 minutes. Aegean Airlines manages to provide better services than other bigger airlines even in shorter routes. Definitely deserves 4 stars.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Paris to Athens, on a new A320 with sharklets. The plane was clean inside and very quiet. Soon after take-off, we were offered a selection of drinks and newspapers, and a warm towel. After that, I was served a Greek delicacy, namely, rooster braised in red wine sauce, accompanied by noodles and some greens. Having finished my meal, I took another drink, and soon after we were less than an hour away from our destination. We landed on time. Very good overall experience. I enjoy flying Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Warsaw return, with a group of friends, on seperate bookings. Aegean Airlines still maintains a lot of elements of the old airline service industry. Online check-in with selection of seat available, however the choice of seat varies, depending on the booking class of the ticket and/or any frequent flyer status. Both flights 80-90% full on economy. They charge for checked luggage, but they do allow check in hand luggage, so that the cabin does not become too cramped, which we did. Food was more than satisfactory - on the return flight I had requested a seafood meal which was superb (in combination with a very nice local white wine). There are options to request about 7 or 8 different types of meals depending on dietic preferences. Crew were very polite and very professional. All flights on time. Bridge used 3 out of 4 times. Flying Aegean is normally a stressless and comforting experience and this time was no exception.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Cabin crew service remains top class. In an age where most airlines across Europe are abandoning inflight service, Aegean crew made at least three runs delivering drinks. The hot meal served (pastitsio) was superb, together with Greek salad and Greek desert. We were also welcomed on board with a gift-wrapped pomegranate as a lucky charm for the New Year. The plane was new and spotless. The flight was on time. Aegean crew are to be congratulated for their warm welcome and hard work throughout the four hour flight. Flying Aegean is always a treat!",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to Rome with Aegean Airlines. The attendants were extremely polite, warm and willing to help while there were also christmas tricks for the children. The food however the last two times I travelled has changed to smaller portions and lower quality. In older times the food of this airline was exceptional! I suppose is the competency of other low cost airlines. In addition the online check-in appears the whole plane to be full and you have no seat choice. I dont know then why to check in online before? ",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10," I flew 4 sectors with Aegean Kiev to Heraklion via Athens and then to Belgrade. The level of service is consistent. Warm meal served on the flight from Kiev (2 hours). Candies distributed before departure which is a nice touch and certainly doesn't cost much. Legroom is better than Air Serbia due to thin seats. On the flight to Belgrade we were served a sandwich which was at least twice bigger than its competitor on the route, but as much lower in quality. It was basically a bread-bun. All in all I would recommend Aegean, the main downside being the ATH airport which is very unfriendly and has no proper space or rest areas for long-transits. Polite and attentive crew. Attention to detail and consistent service. No IFE, nice legroom and a good meal on longer flights. Boarding in ATH 80% of the time being done at remote stands like low-cost carriers, even in cold and windy weather. Luggage policy seldomly applied, at some stations strict one-bag policy as Wizz Air / Ryanair, at others no one pays attention. No proper business class. Poor quality meal on shorter flights. ATH airport makes Aegean unattractive as a transit airline making for poor transfers if the wait time is longer than a few hours (very frequent in winter). Reaching Athens to spend a night can also be very expensive and time-consuming (distance to the city being 45 kilometers).",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10," Athens to Paris CDG with Aegean Airlines. 48h prior to departure passengers receive an email which encourages them to check in online so that they can choose their seat, free of charge. However, even if you try the online check-in in the very first minute of these 48h, the seat map of your flight will appear full and you won’t be able to change your allocated seat. This is a constant situation for more than a year now and it affects even passengers with flexible fares. The call centre, unable or unwilling to help, simply confirms their practice of “preseating” which does not allow you to seat next to a friend or colleague with whom you don’t share the same book reference. The experience at Aegean drop-off check-in in ATH is awful, especially if your flight departs between 8:00 and 10:00 a.m. Cabin crew members are in general distant, indifferent and not necessarily polite enough. Service on board is average. Instead of caring for the comfort of all their passengers, Aegean are crawling to families (“Aegean for families”). Therefore, avoid this airline, unless you’re travelling with kids. This must be the only chance you have to get a decent service from them.",no
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"  Athens to Larnaca. It seems that this airline does not like passenger walkways in and out of the terminal on this sector, because bus tranport was used. Arriving at Larnaca, space was available but we had to enjoy bus ride to the terminal. Inflight service as always is very professional, brand new A320, punctual flights, but despite the fare, breakfast was below expectations. Not to mention the high cost of a suitcase for such a short flight. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"As usual a very pleasant experience with Aegean flying from Athens to Paris. Modern, clean aircraft, good food. Aegean is one of the few remaining airlines that serves a hot meal, which is much appreciated and deserves to be applauded. The crew were professional and well groomed, on both legs. On the return flight from Paris I requested a newspaper when boarding, which was brought to my seat after they were distributed to business class passengers. This was excellent service from the flight director from whom I requested it. Wi-Fi was available on this flight, but I could not log in for some reason. In-flight entertainment needs to be improved. At least some music. Overall, I always look forward to flying with Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Rome to Athens, and a great flight as usual on Aegean Airlines. The flight took of slightly off schedule but landed on-time. Inflight meal was good but not enough of a portion for longer flights. Flight attendants helpful and nice, some were helping passengers with cabin-luggage stowage which is very nice. Cabin luggage policy was not strict which is appreciated. The cabin was very clean, something always consistent on Aegean. Best of all are the prices; Aegean offers great value for money while retaining higher standards of service. Keep it up Aegean. One suggestion is, Aegean should either introduce inflight Wifi or personal entertainment monitors. This would make their flights less dull and boring.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Amsterdam to Athens with Aegean Airlines. I never flown this airline before and my expectations weren't very high. By luck I flew on a new plane including sharklets. Once airborn the stewardess was serving a hot-meal with cold or warm beverages. It was suprising to me because It was only a 3-hour flight. After a smooth ride we landed right on schedule in Athens. My overall experience with Aegean was great and I look forward to flying with them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flights from Athens to Paris and from Paris to Ioannina via Athens. The cabin crew was attentive, smiling and courteous. Aircraft seats and toilets were clean. In my opinion in-flight meals need some upgrade even with a fee for economy class passengers. They lack in variety and quantity. Bar-tea-coffee service was excellent. From Athens to Ioannina flight was smooth and comfortable aboard the Olympic air Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft. Cabin attendants wonderful once more. I think that both Aegean and Olympic air are consistently the pride of Greece amid all our pessimism and depression.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"My last flight with Aegean was as pleasant as the previous ones. Due to my Miles & Bonus Gold card, my travel companion and I were complimentarily upgraded to Business Class, with a tasty meal and several rounds of excellent Greek wine. Return flight was announced as cancelled due to a strike of air traffic control. As the company was not to be reached on the phone or at the airport, and as we absolutely had to be back home on the planed day, we had to endure a return from Athens to Switzerland via following routing: taxi to Patras, ferry to Bari (Italy), rental car from Bari to Rome, then a flight from Rome to Geneva. Apart from the length of the trip (30 hours in total), all this cost us several hundred Euros. At our surprise and satisfaction, Aegean Airlines did reimburse us all these expenses. We were very pleased with the treatment of our case and will definitely fly again with Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Berlin to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Very good and kind ground and cabin staff service. The seats are comfortable with a lot of space between the seats and the rows. Foods is delicious. You can try Greek traditional food. Personally I think that is a big plus for Aegean Airlines because in most of European airlines you have to pay on board for food and beverages - even for a glass of water.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"Milan to Athens with Aegean Airlines. A normal flight with normal conditions. Departed on schedule, arrived likewise. Being a short haul flight the onboard food and beverages are basic at best. Correct English of flight attendants is a plus. It is the only direct flight from Milan to Athens.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  I flew Stockholm to Athens return and Athens to Santorini and Cairo to Athens. All flights on good time. Great meals on board included in ticket price, which surprised me as most intra-continental flights at most have a simple snack/sandwich included. Nice staff overall. Seats were decent, I didn't need to stand up at any point during flights. My new favourite airline in Europe!",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"Athens to Warsaw with Aegean Airlines. Being a regular flyer especially on routes where I have little or no choice of carrier, I feel that this airline avoids the use of terminal walkways - for reasons that anybody can guess - and chooses the use of good old tiring busses as if we are in the 50s. This I have experienced on many flights on Aegean from Larnaca, Munich, Madrid to name but a few. This was again the case for my recent flight both ways to and from Warsaw. Good old bus at Athens airport and then into a semi-dark ground floor in an airport which has no moving walkways for pedestrians and you have to walk from one end to the other. This bus service can happen on any airline but on Aegean it's probably my hard luck or the system. What they called breakfast was an ugly little spinach pie and coffee, on the return flight however, dinner was good. The plane as always looks clean and tidy though the inflight magazine looked horribly overused. The flight was smooth and punctual, and what I have always appreciated is the professionalism of cabin attendants, they are more than willing to help.",no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"  Thessaloniki to Stockholm via Athens. Aegean Airlines is an airline with high cost to value. I found the seats small and uncomfortable and there is lack of inflight entertainment. Food bad and portions pretty small. There is no onboard wifi and overhead screens play advertisements. Also, cabin lights were mostly on during this short flight.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Chania to Tehran via Athens. Aegean brings the joy of flying back into the air! The tray service offering warm tasty food on short-haul flights is just amazing. Flew on it from Europe to Tehran and back recently and it was a wonderful experience of Greece in the air. All the FA's were nice, smiling and enthusiastic about their work. The hub at ATH also very comfortable and clean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Athens to London Heathrow. Best mid-haul flight I've taken in years. Seats were very comfortable, and we had more leg room in a regular economy seat than in paid exit row seats I've taken on other airlines - good news as my partner and I are both very tall. We were offered a sweet on take-off, drinks throughout the flight and a free meal - all rarities these days. My only criticism would be that the handing out of food seemed quite chaotic - staff walking up and down the plane distributing meals in a seemingly random pattern. But all in all a fantastic experience.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  London to Athens. I flew business class (first time on an international flight. Flight was on time and the aircraft was clean. Cabin crew was friendly, confident with a genuine smile. There is no need to say much related to legroom, as the space was more than enough. Pre-flight drink was offered with option to choose among water, orange juice or sparkling wine. The three course dinner (with 2 main courses to choose from) was delicious. There was a range of different coffees to choose. So far my experience with Aegean has been more than positive. It is a reliable company and its cabin crew know how to make each flight enjoyable. Furthermore offers a good quality vs price relationship. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"  London Heathrow to Athens. I can say this is the most child non-friendly airline I've been on. I travelled with my 60 year old mom and my 16 month old daughter.  I had thought we'd either get some help or at least some priority, but staff were not interested in in helping out. When we were trying to manage our luggage in the overhead compartments we just got blank stares. I would highly not recommend this airline for any family, and to think they pride themselves for their family services.",no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,"  My experience with Aegean airlines has been very bad.  I had a trip from Milan to Rhodes via Athens return in October - I experienced the effect of strike called for 9 october 2016. Flight canceled. No warning of the incoming strike, so no time to find a re-route accomodation. On-line check-in forbidden for my flight without explanation. I just arrived on thodes airport for check-in, 8 oct afternoon, and the ground staff told me my next flight from to Milan was cancelled. No willing to help, just address me to a mile-long queue for finding an exchange flight.  Aegean call a strike, doesn't warn its customer and they believe it is normal, so no reasons to complain. She answered that ""it happens"". If this was not enough, flight started with 1 hour of delay. Arrived in Athens, I spent all night in queue with hundreds of angry people waiting for the ticket office of Aegean to find solutions. Strike was recalled, but my flight remained canceled anyway. So after almost 6 hours of queue, I found a solution adding a stopover at Vienna through Austrian airlines. I had to sleep in a hotel and staff member ensured me that taxi trip should be offered by them, but after writing to customer service and having no answers about I can say it was no true.  I came back home 10 hours later than expected. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Milan Malpensa to Athens return. Flights on time, aircraft clean with very good legroom. Nice to receive a hot meal and beverage. Good service onboard and nice crew. Among many lower fare companies, Aegean stands for a good relationship between quality and price. I'm looking forward to fly them again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  Second time flying with Aegean in the last 3 months from London Heathrow to Mytilene via Athens and must say I will fly Aegean every time I fly whereever possible. Find Aegean 10 out of 10 from the ground staff checking you in to the the cabin crew back to the ground crew at final place. All flights on time (including connecting and return flights) well looked after on all with drinks and meals makes flying a joy again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Athens to Geneva. I've flown on Aegean Airlines before and never had any problems. I did my check in online but I couldn't complete it as I had a booking on stand by. The waiting for the check in Athens airport was not very long and it was very reasonable. I asked to tag my bag to my final destination because I had a different booking to Montreal with Air Canada which is a partner airline. The system didn't let it even if the check in lady try to do so. Probably because my booking was on stand by. However she put a priority tag on my bag which ended to come out fast in Geneva. The flight was quite full with very few seats left. The cabin crew was not very interacting with passengers. The service onboard was good and a hot meal was provided with a choice of drinks all free of charge. The inflight entertaiment was a video featuring some tourist attractions of some Greek islands. Overall Aegean airlines is a good and it offers a good range of destinations but they're limited only to Europe and some destinations to the Middle East. I would recommend this airline.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"I fly Aegean Airlines twice a month on a regular basis as part of my commute from France, where I work, to Greece where my home is. All things being relatively equal, from all available carriers on the Paris-Athens route, A3 is definitely my airline of choice. A few random things, which I'd like to emphasize: 1) Cabin crew are impeccably behaved and presented and always ready to accommodate my requests. 2) Air-fi which was provided on my last flights is quite interesting and compensates for the lack of individual screens in the cabin. I only hope that its content will be constantly updated and enriched (it would be a disappointment, if on my next flight in 10 days I'd be obliged to browse through the same material again) 3) Reserving front W.C. only for business class passengers (typically 8-12 per flight, which is on or about 5% of the plane's seating capacity) does not make a lot of sense and occasionally creates lots of discomfort to economy class passengers. Without undermining the premium service afforded to business class passengers, Aegean could consider a derogation to this policy. 4) As a miles and bonus silver member, I'm looking forward to upgrade to the golden tier soon. As a silver member however, I believe that A3 should reconsider silver tier's benefits and in particular the coupons for complimentary access to business class lounges so that they are offered not only in Greek airports but also to int'l ones as well. All in all my experience with Aegean has been positive since it's reliable, efficient, modern and has by far the most pleasant and professional cabin crew. The few downsides to my A3 experience are merely minor improvement challenges.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Lille to Athens return with Aegean Airlines. The outbound flight was great, I was offered a nice meal and a great white wine. The inbound flight was a morning flight, so there was no wine, but the meal was very nice, some kind of spinach/tomato pie accompanied by a large yogurt with honey and a bun with some cheese and butter. Unfortunately, the inbound flight was quite bumpy (from Croatia until across the Alps), and the service got suspended at some point. The fact that I was returning from vacation did not help fully enjoying the flight either, as I was quite miserable. All in all, very good experience with Aegean, (I fly them regularly from Paris), and the planes were also clean and comfortable.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Return flight from Vienna to Athens (then connecting onwards on Olympic Air). Fantastic airline, starting from the easy booking process, smooth web checkin and opportunity to select reasonable seats without being hit with all manner of surcharges. At the airport there were short and swift queues to drop off luggage followed by timely boarding and on-time departures both ways. Onboard, greeted by pleasant, elegantly dressed hostesses, sweets for take-off, full meal with bar service tea and coffee. Overhead TVs showed the moving map with on-time arrivals on both flights. All in all a very comfortable, enjoyable and rare experience!",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"I flew with Aegean Airlines back home after my recent holiday in Mykonos. As a Miles & Bonus Gold Member I was upgraded complimentary to Business Class on the Athens - Geneva leg, which was wonderful. We were perfectly looked after by the Maitre de Cabine, who served us a delicious meal and tasty wines. Transit in Athens was quick and painless, without additional security check. The only thing that Aegean could improve would be to have a separate counter for Gold Members at Mykonos airport, as it was not very appreciable to have to queue for bag drop during 10-15 minutes.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  London to Mykonos via Athens, return. Efficient and quick check in at LHR Terminal 2. Boarding process was handled by non-Aegean ground staff and was badly organised and scrappy. Met at door by polite and immaculate looking crew with a smile and warm greeting. Take off was 40 min late, with drinks service shortly after. Good selection of soft drinks plus a small bottle of red or white wine for the meal. Hit some bad turbulence just as the meal service started so the captain illuminated the fasten seat belt sign and made an announcement that the service was suspended. This went on for most of the flight. The crew managed to check the cabin to ensure that passengers were ok which was very commendable, considering how bumpy the flight was. The turbulence subsided about an hour from landing at Athens and the crew recommenced the full meal service, understanding that time was against us. All trays and cups were cleared with 10 minutes left before landing. We landed at Athens 50 minutes early. Full marks to the crew who handled a very difficult situation with professionalism and charm. They never appeared stressed and were a comforting sight for many uneasy passengers. The Captain kept us informed throughout and made a soft landing. Well done to all. A great flight apart from the bumps and great food too.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Flew from Prague to Heraklion direct, which was a nice thing to discover as I normally fly back to Crete via Athens. Not the first time choosing Aegean Airlines, but again an amazing, warm experience with them. Very convenient departure time, new, clean and modern aircraft. From the moment you step on the plane you feel the warmth of the Greek hospitality. I think one of the strongest aspects is their cabin crew. They are always smiling, they look really confident, approachable and that they are really enjoying their job. I am happy to discover that they are expanding their routes with more direct flights to Europe. Looking forward to fly with Aegean again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Airport staff at Düsseldorf airport were friendly and accommodating however, the check-in and bag drop counters were not opened until 3 hours before the flight and they took a lot of time to actually open the counters. That being said however, they were very efficient and fast. Moving on, the seats on both flights were comfortable and just ample for the regional midrange operations of the company, but the lack of on-board entertainment was evident. The food despite tasting good, was of very small portions and the fact that no hot beverages were served on the Düsseldorf-Athens 3 hr leg was not appreciated. Athens airport is nice, easily navigable and efficient however, a layover longer than three hours will be boring and food options were not enough. Duty free and shopping options were very broad and rather time passing. The flight attendants were all very nice. Aegean airlines offer a consistent level of good service and always have good prices from Jordan. Keep it up Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Paris to Athens in August. I was upgraded into business class which was very nice touch (LH status). The legroom was enough, the food was adequate (even though there was no much choice) and the cabin crew were attentive. There is no inflight entertainment as the promotional video about Greece was shown throughout the flight. We arrived on time and luggage delivery was super-fast which was excellent after 3 hours flight. Overall Aegean is a high quality airline. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Athens to Tbilisi in August. Athens airport is very easy to navigate with supportive ground staff. I was surprised that no priority boarding enforced by Aegean airlines (boarding started for everyone at the same time). Onboard I found the economy cabin to be very clean with modern cabin. The legroom was ok. Cabin crew did good job and were attentive to all passengers. Hot meal was served which is really good point but the quality of the meal was below average (baked pasta with meat). Overall, this was good flight but the meal service in economy class could be improved especially in comparison with Turkish Airlines or Lufthansa (on routes from Europe to Georgia). I would recommend Aegean airlines without hesitation as it is very reliable regional airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Flew last week from Athens to Corfu with Aegean Airlines. Once again excellent experience, professional and friendly crew, clean aircraft and on time departure. We also received a snack and a beverage on a 40-minute flight. IFE was OK, as a route map was shown. The seat is so comfortable with a big amount of legroom. Its definitely value for money as I paid for return flight, on high season, 60€ only. I would recommend Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  We flew from Athens to Paris via Thessaloniki. Both flight were on time. The cabin was new and clean for the two flight. Cabin crew were efficient and smiling. We received a hot breakfast and during the flight, the captain gave us flight information. Overall, very good performance. Will definitely fly them again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Stuttgart to Thessaloniki with Aegean Airlines. Friendly and courteous staff, good food and beverage offer (choice, taste, composition) and great service! Always my pleasure!",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew from Heraklion to London Gatwick. The first thing that impressed me was the size of the legroom available. It was much more than we were expecting. I was in the same row of a particularly tall man and he was able to stretch and cross his legs comfortably. It was certainly helpful with storing our bags and stretching out. The crew cabin were professional and helpful and the food was nice if a bit stingy on the olives in the Greek salad (just one!). What the flight needed was an option for some decent IFE as all we got was a travelogue of Greece which made us sadder as we loved Crete and we didn't want to leave! Also some Wifi service would have also been a good idea for the flight. Will fly with them again if we get the chance as it was a very enjoyable experience.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"London Heathrow to Larnaca. First time we flew with Aegean a family of 2 adults, 1 teenager and 1 child. We were very impressed. I am a nervous flier and was very sceptical to fly with them my travel agent said they're very good and not to worry. He was right. The crew are so friendly and reminds me of how it was to fly as a child they give you a sweet before take off, a cute pilot badge for the kids and the creme de la creme is the hot meal no one gives a meal these days what a lovely touch, and the many rounds of drink they offer is awesome - the only thing they could improve on is the time of the outbound flight and they really could do with some in flight entertainment. Thank you for making me enjoy flying again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Always happy to fly with Aegean Airlines. Flew from Brussels to Athens. Very professional, flight on time, good food on board, clean aircraft, and I was happy to see a male cabin crew for the first time. Inflight entertainment should be improved. Most people nowadays do have a tablet, mobile etc but they should at least try to have different videos. Ticket price? 68 euro. You dont get that every day but when you get lucky, you get lucky.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew Aegean Airlines from Heraklion to Copenhagen. Very comfortable seats and cabin. Able to fly for 3½ hours non stop, with excellent customer service, tasty meals and lots of free beverages. Friendly cabin crew, always smiling and service-minded. A nice welcome with a candy, meal, unlimited free coffee/tea/water. Excellent.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  My flight to London was a wonderful experience. The seat, made of leather, was really comfortable. The food tasted really good, and it reflects greek gastronomy. The staff were happy to serve with a smile. The only thing I didn't like about the flight is the IFE. In our 3,5 hour flight, a promo film about Greece was playing on the first two hours and the a map was been showed. No one could manage to watch a two hour film about all the islands, mountains, cities of Greece. A map at the whole flight would have been better, so passengers could have a quick look of what they are watching outside their window. Overall Aegean is a high quality airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Arrived at the excellent Athens Airport after an uncomfortable and unpleasant flight on Swiss. Aegean Airlines check in was busy but nearly all desks were manned so queuing time was minimal. Check in was polite and professional with boarding gate and directions explained in perfect English. Very clean looking A320. Welcomed on board by immaculate looking cabin crew with a ready smile. Engaged with passengers as we boarded which was nice, especially children. Offered baskets of sweets pre-take off. Nice touch. On time departure. No drinks as short flight but individually wrapped biscuits offered to each passenger with a napkin. Again, nice touch. Perfect English announcements given by Purser and Captain during flight, landed early. Great service. Aegean deserve to be awarded 4 star status. Inflight mag is full of lovely pictures of Greece.

",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"I flew with Aegean Airlines on May 2016 from Milan to Athens. Honestly speaking the price was the same as with Ryanair for the same route (but from a different airport) however I could check in 20kg so obviously I chose Milan–Malpensa, since I am from those who believe that when you fly you want to have comfort. Aegean Airlines has friendly staff, free in cabin beverages and food (for a 1 30 h flight). On top of that the flight was on time and the seats were more than comfortable. Since I drink a lot of water I kindly asked for a few times water which was provided to me without second thought. On the negative side, I would expect in the future to have in flight entertainment such as a personal TV screen and Wifi connectivity. Aegean Airlines during the summer connects a lot of international passengers to the Greek Islands and I think from next summer they should consider doing it. (For example Air Canada has personal screens for its passengers from flights such as Toronto-Ottawa). One final note, its Blue magazine is amazing and who ever reads it can discover the beautiness of Greece. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Thessaloniki to Frankfurt. Aegean Airlines did a great job on this flight. They allow boarding the busses directly from their lounge at Thessaloniki airport which saves time and hassle for business and FQT passengers. Otherwise their Thessaloniki lounge is nothing special, they definitely need more toilets and its quite remote and not easy to find. Their staff, however, both on the ground and in the air, was very friendly. The cabin looked spotless clean and their catering was just delicious. Three course meal with 3 main courses to choose from, two regular choices plus a monthly special, which i chose: Rooster ragout in sweet wine sauce with greek pasta. No special business class seating, but normal economy seats with the middle seat left free for extra space. During the flight they showed some travel magazines on their video screens as a kind of inflight entertainment. I've flown Aegean Airlines now a couple of times and they never disappointed me.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Mykonos to Athens. Very busy check in at Mykonos Airport but handled with a smile and courtesy. On time departure on very clean A320 both inside and out. Cabin crew were immaculate. Elegant, spoke perfect English and service with a sincere smile and impeccable manners. Short flight so only an individually wrapped cookie. Captain gave good announcements and landed early. Aegean Airlines deserve to be awarded 4 star status. They are better than bigger airlines.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Vienna to Heraklion via Athens with Aegean Airlines. The bording procedure was very efficient and the welcome drink - a glass of champange - was served with a genuine smile. The food and drink selection was superb and I was quite astonished that a range of different coffees (from espresso to cappucino) was available even on the (very) shorthaul flight from ATH to HER. Likewise, the quality of the meals and beverages met my expecations fully. It has to be mentioned that the crew was doing an outstandingly good job and also cared for little details which made me feel mostly welcome as a passenger. The planes were punctual and the priority disembarking worked remarkably well on both flights. Overall they provide an excellent product and I am looking forward to fly with Aegean again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Copenhagen - Athens return with Aegean Airlines. Both flights on time. Aircrafts new and clean. Seats a bit thin but comfortable. Good legroom for the European standards. No IF entertainment. Overhead screens display promotional videos of Greece. On CPH-ATH leg we were served a warm meal which was delicious. 3 rounds of drinks to choose between 2 types of red wine, 2 types of white wine, beer, juice, sodas and lots of coffee and tea. Return flight same good. A very tasty warm breakfast was served including yoghurt with honey. Lots of drinks again but not alcoholic as it was a morning flight. But what really made the difference on those flights was the genuine smile of the crew who really seemed to enjoy their job. I would definitely use this airline again when flying to Greece.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Flew last month from Athens to Geneva on an A320. I had already mobile checked-in via the very good mobile app. Ground service was excellent in Athens airport. Even though the flight was fully booked we departed on time. Cabin crew members were all very professional, very friendly and seemed to enjoy what they do. On a 2.5 hour flight we were served with a hot meal, including pasta, salad, crackers and a tasty lemon pie. Lots of drinks were complimentary (even alcoholic). In the monitors above there was a route map and a promo video for Greece. Even if there is no other IFE, it's OK as it's a short flight. We arrived in Geneva on time. I would recommend Aegean for their excellent service, their kindness and their punctuality. For me is one of the top-notch airlines in Europe and I prefer among other airlines that operate the same route.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Flew London Heathrow to Naxos via Athens. This was the first time I have flown with Aegean and I was very impressed. Check in at Heathrow was speedy and painless and all the staff were helpful and smiling. The plane was clean and new, food and service excellent and staff really seemed to enjoy their job. The return journey was as good. I will be flying this airline again if they are on my route.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Rhodes to London Gatwick via Heraklion. No line at check in, lovely warm welcome from agent. Both flights boarded efficiently and had friendly and kind crews. Lots of drinks and nice food with genuine feeling of Greek hospitality. Loads of leg room for a tall Brit like me. On time throughout. Highly recommended. So preferable to the shambolic, unprofessional and very uncomfortable flight I had on British Airways in other direction.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,  First time flying with Aegean with connecting flights at Athens to Lesbos and was unsure what to expect but must say that the moment we had first contact at check in we was greeted by friendly staff who told us that we don't have to worry about bags as next time we see them will be at our final point for picking up. The flight itself was very old school with free drinks and free meal served by warm staff which was a really nice touch and made the flight go smoothly. Connections at Athens airport was smooth and easy with no fuss and second flight to our final destination was just as smooth. Return flights at end of the were the same good service. Flying same route in September with Aegean (already booked) with views of booking again in October.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10," Flew Munich to Athens via Thessaloniki. Aegean Airlines is an example for all european economy-class carriers. Clean and modern cabins, very professional and friendly crew, fantastic service on-board. There is no IFE, but as the average flight between Germany and Greece is about 2 hours, you don't need one. Aegean promotes in the best way Greek cuisine and hospitality. A fantastic breakfast, with Greek yoghurt with honey, a tiropita (cheese-pie), and a wide choice of complimentary drinks (also alcoholic). Even if I have to pay more than other carriers, Aegean is my top choice.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"We booked with Aegean Airlines for Santorini so we would avoid the summer craze. The website is very easy to use, automatically provided in Italian when accesing it from Italy. Checked smoothly and speedy from Rome. Cabin was new and seemed to be clean, seats where standard ones that you would find in the likes of Lufthansa. Warm meal was provided which I found to be very tasty. My boyfriend had his kosher meal served to him as he specified on the website. The highlight of the trip would be the stewardesses that seemed to be happy to be there, I have flown with them another two times and I have to say that they are more attending and serviceable than any other major european airline I have flown. Magazines were waiting for us on the seats which can be keeping company to solo flyers as there is no other in flight entertaiment provided. Drop screens show the route the plane takes and some weather information on the destination, as well as some promotional videos of Greece. Arriving in Athens we borded the second flight quickly and we were on our way to Santorini. Same story there with all the goods from the FCO to ATH flight minus the meal. I would fly with them again in the future as we visit the Greek islands often.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Athens to Zurich. I had already flown business with Aegean Airlines once and I really enjoyed the comfort and the service. The second time was as good as the first one. Priority boarding worked very well, crew was welcoming and caring. I was impressed by the attention to details - when people were boarding and walking up the stairs of the aircraft, the flight attendant noticed a mother with a baby at the end of the queue and she immediately reacted and gave priority to them. Crew had a genuine smile and was attentive. The captain provided information on the flight and the destination several times. The food was delicious (sea food special meal: asparagus salad with tuna as a starter, sea bream and grilled vegetables as a main dish with a very good selection of drinks and sweets). I had one request concerning my ""miles and bonus"" account and asked for help through the online contact form. I received a detailed e-mail in addition to a phone call and the issue was solved immediately. Aegean is being consistent for years now with their excellent service as an airline and I hope that they will keep up like this in the future.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Tel Aviv to Rome via Athens with Aegean Airlines. Cheap price, comfortable seats, pleasant crew, comfortable flight. Truthfully this airline met every expectation and I would happily fly them again. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Last December I had a flight from Heraklion to Warsaw through Athens with Aegean Airlines. Food in business class was delicious and service excellent.  Ground Staff were polite and flights were on time. The only complaint I had was with some flights within Greece. Many passengers take with them onboard not only their handbag, but 2 or 3 bags, it can be very slow to stand and wait for them to store their bags. On long distance flights (Athens-London, Athens-Moscow etc) I would like improvements in the in-flight entertainment and larger food portions.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Zurich to Athens, and once again it was a pleasant flight with Aegean Airlines which I prefer over other alternatives. To start with mobile check-in, very quick and easy to navigate (on website) process. Boarding was smooth, crew genuinely friendly and professional. I like the fact that they are flexible in terms of providing this ""extra"" service when asked for, even for passengers flying economy (eg. a newspaper, an extra drink etc.). Food is better from what one expects from a short european flight - I had shrimps, fish and steamed vegetables on a 2.5 hours flight (on economy flight). Leg space was plenty, the airplane was new and clean. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  
Aegean is a good airline. I flew Athens to Berlin, round trip, Business Class. Boarding in Athens was fast. Aircraft clean and new, crew friendly and offering service with a smile. Meals are ok. I had ordered special meal due to some dietary restrictions and this was delivered correctly. Service and ingredients is comparable to airlines doing similar route. Drinks were offered multiple times through the flight. Coffee offered, dessert also which was delicious. Departed on-time, landed on-time. An efficient airline and delivers the flying service well. Business Class experience could probably be better with some inflight entertainment added, but still this is a 2h30m flight where you hardly have time to offer meals and relax a bit, so, no complains at all. Highlight of the flight is the cabin service from the crew. Flight back from Berlin to Athens. Experience in Berlin Tegel Airport in comparison to Athens airport is not good and this is common with all airlines, since the airport is old. Athens airport is so much better. Flight back was equally good. Flight departed with a 15m delay but landed 20m early. I would fly with Aegean Airlines again with no second thoughts.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Flew Athens to London Heathrow with Aegean Airlines. Excellent inflight service, smiling and efficient cabin crew, flights on time and a very clean cabin. Economy class hot meals could be improved in terms of quantity and appearance but still a plus for intra-european flights. I would also prefer a wider IFE choice.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"  Madrid to Athens and the flight was completely full, however boarding was done in a timely manner. Departure and arrival on time, despite a strike of air traffic controllers in France. Checked in using the mobile phone app and chose my seat (11A). Checked in my hand luggage, as I did not want to carry it around and worry about where to store it in the cabin. Free catering - food was tasty, however not plenty - asked for a second bread, but they did not give me. Plenty of drinks. Drop down screens which demonstrated areas of tourist interest in Greece and the route map and flight data. In flight magazine provided. Announcements made in Greek, English and Spanish - there was at least one cabin crew member fluent in Spanish. Good leg space. Quick disembarcation using a bridge - luggage did not take long. Very good value for money (50 EUR). It was a pleasure flying with Aegean Airlines.
",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"  Athens to Lyons return with Aegean Airlines. The A320 was ok and clean. Both flights were on time. Food service was very good. Staff was friendly, announcements were on Greek, English, French. There is no IFE or tablet with uploaded movies. There were dropdown screens with flight directions and advertisements about Greece. Boring  for the almost 3 hour flight.  Seats were standard but comfortable.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Had to fly non short notice to Thessaloniki. Website is easy to use, booking completed within a few minutes. Check-in and boarding very smooth. Welcoming, friendly crew. Seats are standard seats with middle seat free in between. Good service onboard the flight, high quality of food and drinks. The flight was very pleasant as was the flight back two days later. Their lounge at SKG is quiet and boarding is through the lounge with seperate bus to the plane.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"  Aegean Airlines from Munich to Thessaloniki with a high level of service, the cabin crew is able to combine friendliness with efficiency. I slept most of the time because I was exhausted, but when I woke up, about 30 minutes before landing, they served me the dinner and even managed to end it with a mastiha. Aegean Airlines is my preferred airline whenever I fly to Greece but now will also consider them for stopover to their other destinations, just to have this home-coming feeling again, something that is rare nowadays in flight industry.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Athens to Barcelona with Aegean Airlines and a pleasant flight, left on time, about 80-85% full, crew friendly, smiling and efficient. Breakfast served and passengers with hand luggage were asked to check in their hand-luggage free of charge in order to make more space for the cabin, which I did. Very good leg space (my height is 185cm). Used mobile check in and went straight to the gate, which was very convenient. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Rome to Athens with Aegean Airlines. The aircraft was very clean and the seats were spotless. But what set the airline apart were the flight attendants, its amazing what a genuine smile can do to a passenger. All the crew seemed genuinely happy to be doing their job. I sat in the row behind my family and spoke to the two ladies beside me and they felt the same way. Getting off I mentioned to one of the girls how I felt and got another genuine smile - well done indeed Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"My wife and I flew Aegean Airlines from Santorini to Athens in a Airbus A320, overnight in Athens and on to Heathrow the next day in a Airbus A321. Both flights were full and left and arrived on time. A choc-chip cookie was served on the short Athens leg with a full meal and bar service on the flight to London.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Thessaloniki to Munich with Aegean Airlines. The aircraft was clean, cabin crew service was polite and professional, and the space of the seats was comfortable. Meal was plenty and very tasty. although I am a gluten free-passenger, the meal was more of a hindu-meal and I am not Indian to like this kind of food. Overall my experience was good to excellent.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Athens to Rome, and my third flight with Aegean Airlines, and they improved their service the last 2 years. For a 2 hour flight the service was equal as a part of an intercontinental flight. No IFE - not sure if need in a short flight with a regional carrier, but in any case not many airlines in Europe offer this value for money. Compliments.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Flew Aegean Airlines from London Heathrow to Samos via Athens, and the first time I have flown with this airline. Very good cabin crew, leg room much more then a lot of airlines, I am 6 ft and I still had plenty of leg room. Meal was good and a complementary drink. When I fly in summer I use Thomson (TUI) direct to Samos, but I have to say Aegean Airlines is better, and a better price with more luggage allowance on a flexi ticket. Would recommend and use again.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew with Aegean Airlines on January 17 from Athens to Frankfurt. The flight was nearly full but the cabin crew did a great job at providing everyone with a full meal service and two rounds of drink service. We left and arrived on time without any hassles. There is a lot of legroom available and the seats were very comfortable.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"We travelled Aegean Airlines from London to Athens on 8th Jan and back to London on 12th Jan. On both flights, boarding was speedy, we arrived at our destinations early and the flight was smooth. The cabin crew were smartly dressed. As soon as we took our seats, we were given a boiled sweet, and the meal was very nice. There was inflight entertainment on the drop down screens and the legroom seemed to be quite a lot - maybe because I usually fly with easyJet. If you want a comfortable, efficient service then I would recommend Aegean. We even had two complementary drink rounds in a 3 hour flight!",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"At MAD they are using the Star Alliance’s lounge at Terminal 2. Both flights from Athens to Madrid with Aegean Airlines were on time. Aircraft was ok, the 2 front rows were business class with the middle seat converted to glass rest area. Service was very good and personalized. Pilot made announcements and flight information which was announced in Greek, English and Spanish. Safety information was demonstrated only in Greek and English. They offered welcome drink with a Menu of the food options - Chicken or Veal. Food was tasty (salad, chicken, desert). There was no IFE but on the display there was the flight path. Also there was value sales carriage.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Athens to Paris, and vice versa. I prefer Aegean Airlines whenever I fly between Paris and Athens. The food is excellent, staff professional and elegant, and the planes are newish and clean. I cannot say I have had a bad experience with Aegean Airlines, and I fly with it quite frequently. Aegean airlines does not provide video entertainment.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"My family (me, wife, children ages 11 and 14) just completed a trip from Paris to Athens, Istanbul, and Cyprus with stopovers of 3-5 days in each place, six flight legs total between Dec 25 and Jan 8. Each leg was in Economy class on A320-200 aircraft. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of service on all of the flights. All flights, even the short ones between Athens and Istanbul which were a little over one hour, included some sort of meal or snack service with drinks, food, and tea or coffee afterward. Although food portions were relatively small, everything tasted good. The flight crew were all polite and professional. Seats were comfortable for all flights and all planes seemed clean and well-maintained. Online checkin and baggage drop-off were straightforward and simple, and we were able to use family lanes in for baggage drop-off in Athens and Cyprus. There was no individual in-flight entertainment and we did not use Wi-Fi, but I enjoyed watching images from travel destinations in Crete and some of the Greek islands that were displayed on the overhead screens on final return flight from Athens and Paris. The rest of the time, reading and video games on our own devices during flights were fine for entertainment given that all of the flights were under 3 hours. Based on my experience I can highly recommend Aegean for flights in this part of the world.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"I've taken a number of flights with Aegean Airlines on A321 and A320, most recently Thessaloniki to Stockholm via Athens. Aegean is a nice airline, with friendly crew that smile, clean cabins, comfortable seats. Free drinks and hot snack or meal depending on the duration of the flight. Highly reccommended.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Larnaca to Athens and a great flight with Aegean Airlines. Departed on-time after a quick boarding. The inflight meal consisted of a cheese pastry followed by 2 beverage services. The flight was quick, enjoyable and comfortable. We landed early and disembarked right away.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"One more nice experience with Aegean Airlines! On time both flights, great flight attendants, good food and very clean cabin. Cannot ask anything more. Load factor was around 80% on ATH-MAD and 90% on MAD-ATH. Only thing is that they have to improve their in-flight entertainment",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,London to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Polite and easy check in. Efficient boarding with priority given to Business Class. Welcome was with a smile and very courteous crew. Spotless aircraft. Drinks served swiftly followed by excellent meal from a menu with 2 choices of main. Good selection of wines including some award winning Greek ones. Hot towels again served by polite and elegant crew. Landed early. An excellent airline and recommended.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"I had a very nice flight from Athens to Munich with Aegean Airlines. The crew member was great and smiling, and excellent service. Menu was great and the plane was clean. You was able to choose in the businees class to read a newspaper. Weather was fine and the take off and the landing were perfect. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"A bit of a wait at the Business class check in but at least Business/Aegean Miles and Bonus Gold get to use the fast track passport control and security and the dingy Aegean Business class lounge. The lounge offered a reasonable selection of food and drink but not really high-end and the fact that 2 flights were leaving in short succession meant the lounge was fairly crowded at one point. Despite there being several vacant air bridge gates we had to suffer being bussed to a remote stand which involved no priority boarding and being herded onto a bus that was almost bulging at the seams by the time we left. There was a sort of welcome onboard by the cabin crew member as she was on the phone. Pre take off drinks were offered but without any real enthusiasm or engagement. After take off there was the usual hot towel, menu and drinks but no real customer engagement. The cabin crew member pushed the meal trolley into the cabin and set down the table mats and offered bread, placing it on the mat and moved on. A colleague had to tell her that she had forgotten to hand out meal trays. No apology, no making a joke of it, just a robotic performance of giving us our meal trays. That summed up the service. If you wanted anything you had to press the call button because even though various cabin crew floated through the cabin casually glancing at empty glasses at no time did they ask if anyone would like a refill. The liqueur trolley was pushed into the business class cabin but again it was something they had to do because it was in the service plan. London couldn't come quick enough. There was nothing really to thank them for. Cabin crew make the trip. At least the e-passport gates were quiet and after a 5 minute wait my bag was third on the carousel. A shambolic and lacklustre crew spoilt my Aegean business class experience. If this was my only Aegean experience I would never recommend it but thankfully it was my first bad encounter.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"The flight from Athens to Warsaw was short but great. I had not expected it. The crew member was polite and helpful. The range of food and drinks on the menu was impressive. Everything was on time. More important, the take off and landing were smooth. In fact, I bought the ticket for a little money. Considering this, the experience was awesome! The only thing which stops the experience to be a flawless one is the lack of any in-flight entertainments except the Aegean Magazine!",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"London Gatwick to Larnaca via Athens with Aegean Airlines. Business class check in ok, Clubrooms lounge at LGW busy and service disorganised but managed to get a coffee and bacon roll. Boarding business class first and a pleasant welcome on board. Choice of orange, water or sparkling wine before push. After take off, drinks, menus and hot towels. Service good. Tasty meal consisting off a tray with the starter and cheese, followed by a choice of two mains, accompanied by drinks. I sampled a Greek white which was very pleasant. The Greek dessert dish consisted of three small items all of which were nice. The personable lady crew member in charge made sure we were well attended. Liqueurs offered before landing with chocolates. Excellent service. Business class bus to take us from the remote stand to the departure gate at ATH and found my way to the Swissport lounge which was ok. Crowded departure gate with no priority to Business class, so all herded onto a bus like sheep. Another pleasant welcome on board with drinks offered and then another 4 course meal offering on this relatively short 1.45 flight from ATH to LCA. Overall 2 excellent flights and a short wait for my bag. Brilliant. The return trip non stop to LHR with Aegean was far from good.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Very happy with this Aegean Airlines flight. On time departure and early arrival. Cabin crew professional and helpful. Cabin clean and seats comfortable. A small breakfast with coffee included in fare (a real surprise!). So much a better experience than the Ryanair flight we took to Chania approximately a week earlier.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"My wife and I flew Aegean Airlines from Thessaloniki to Larnaca. The staff was very friendly and professional. As soon as we were seated the stewardess offered us drinks and made sure that we were welcome. Later we got a delicious meal - choice of two different meals. Real silverware and china. Even small salt and pepper shaker. The plane looked very new, in business class there was the typical seat configuration 3 left, 3 right - with the middle seat unused. Leg room more than needed.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Athens to Barcelona with Aegean Airlines. Nice service but no IFE provided for the 3.5 hrs flight. The aircraft was normal for European flights. Crew was nice and helpful. Food service was good. There is a pre-flight selection of menu. Both flights were full and on time.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Have flown London to Athens and Athens - Mykonos route many times and find the same high level of service. Cabin crew with smart uniforms and the welcome is with a smile. Boarding was quick and flight time was just 25 minutes. No drinks are served as the flight time is too short, but we were given sweets and a croissant. Aircraft was clean and seats were comfortable. I am puzzled as to why Aegean Airlines has not been upgraded to a 4 star airline. Their level of service is better than some 4 star carriers. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Mykonos to Athens with Aegean Airlines. Check in was easy despite a queue. Ground staff were polite and efficient using perfect English. Aircraft was an A319, spotless interior and welcomed on board by very elegant and immaculately dressed cabin crew with sincere smiles. A tray of sweets was offered to passengers once seated. On time departure and only a 20 minute flight, the crew still served individually wrapped croissants, napkins and refreshment wipes before landing. All served without stress or fuss. Upon deplaning, again the goodbye was sincere with a smile and a thank you. Aegean are a great airline whom I thoroughly recommend.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"I have traveled many times with Aegean Airlines and have never faced any issues. The planes are quite new, staff friendly and the food good considering that most routes are short haul. I guess that slowly the airline should try and include inflight entertainment for longer flights. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"An excellent experience. Flew Aegean Airlines from Istanbul to Athens, then from Athens to Paris. The crew was pleasant, with attentive service. It was a relatively short flight of 1.5 hours but they managed to fit in a meal service and a drink service. The food was standard regional economy affair - pre-packed snacks and nothing exciting, and there was a reasonable selection of drinks. The cabin was clean, and relatively new. The seats were much better than what I'd expect in short-haul economy. As a gold member I was able to book a seat in the first six rows, which has much more generous seat pitch despite being in economy. Because of the slimness of the seats, even seats further down the plan had plenty of legroom. The only criticism is disembarkation in Athens. Apparently most ( if not all) Aegean flights park on the tarmac, and you need to get on a bus to get to the terminal. This obviously takes more time than desirable, but a small drawback in otherwise an great airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"Once on the plane, the Aegean Airlines service is pretty darn good. The cabin flight attendants hustle to get you mints, cookies and water. They all look so good and smile easily. The ground crew and organization (or lack of) in Santorini is epic but in a bad way. What an unorganized mess. Hopfully this airline can get their ground crew working as well as their cabin crew.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Very impressed with these Aegean Airlines flights. Comfortable, fairly modern planes. I liked the magazine holder at the back of the top of the seats (where the TV screen would be on other aircrafts). The toilet facilities were clean. The price of the flight was pretty cheap, 23 kilos of check in luggage was an additional 20 pounds, and the service was excellent. The first leg of the flight was 1 hour 40 mins - during that time you are provided with complimentary refreshments (including alcohol) after take off. You are then provided with a traditional Greek snack, 2 cheese pies and a fig bar, followed by further refreshments. The food was lovely and of a high standard. All the packaging is recyclable.  On the second leg we received the same excellent service and provided with a delicious tomato and pasta bake and fig bar. Also loved the simplicity of the meals and that they were vegetarian. Both ground and in-flight staff were polite, friendly and efficient. Great value for money.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"Aegean Airlines from Athens to Budapest was one of the best short flights I have had. Great service, surprised by hot food served on such a short flight and not too expensive ticket. Great flight attendants and very clean cabin. Will fly them again and recommend them as well.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Aegean Airlines from Santorini to Zurich via Athens, and after many cancelled flights from Athens there were many unhappy customers in the Santorini airport. The staff were fantastic and professional. Considering the bad mood of people they were as helpful as they could be. We flew them a few times during our trip and every time was a great experience. The flight attendants were  great, the pilots very informative and flew a smooth flight every time. The meals and snacks provided were a good surprise. They made our time in Europe great. Thank you Aegean Airlines for a great anniversary trip.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Excellent service from take off to landing on Aegean Airlines flight from Athens to Manchester. Cabin crew are immaculate, efficient and professional. Aircraft was clean and comfortable, take off and landing exceptionally smooth. Looking forward to flying with Aegean airlines again soon. Thank you for a pleasant journey.",yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,"Checked in using the online service but still had to queue as the dedicated bag drop line was checking people in as well. Aegean Airlines flight left on time, service on board was good with a light meal served. Staff friendly and efficient. Aegean seems to value their priority passengers as their luggage comes out first and everyone else had to wait a full 10 minutes for theirs to appear, the first part I understand and accept but the latter has me stumped.",yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,"Aegean Airlines flight from Rhodes to Munich via Thessaloniki. Same issues as last check in with no dedicated bag drop forcing people to queue. Flight on first leg good with light snack offered. Second leg was a different story. Overhead bins full so was only able to fit the duty free in to the overhead bin. Cabin crew decided to make room for someone else so meant that I now had my bag under the seat and the duty free (first time this has ever happened in over 30 years of flying). I asked for them to find space for at least one item as several people had brought multiple bags on board, which they said they would do after take off, this was promptly forgotten. Reminded them when they served dinner but again no one came back which was a bit annoying given the time spent in transit. Flight left late but made up time. Meal served was good plane was clean and well maintained.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"I was very happy with the service from Aegean Airlines flying from ATH to CDG. Check-in was smooth and very easy. Then headed to the lounge, as I am a Gold member of their frequent flier program, Miles and Bonus. The lounge wasn't anything special, but it was still nice to relax with a beer before take-off. The flight itself was great. Cabin crew were very attentive, helpful, and friendly during boarding. They even spoke French. The hot meal provided in economy class along with the nice selection of beverages (including alcohol), was delicious. The plane I was on seemed new and very clean. In general, Aegean made my flying a real pleasure, and I will not hesitate choose them again for my travels in Europe!",yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,"My Aegean Airlines flight was scheduled to leave at 10:50 am from Rome to Athens. Initially everything was fine. I was traveling with a group and our trip was pre booked so to our surprise, we were charged $40.00 fee for carry on. This for me was a shock but I had no choice of course. The woman who checked me in asked me to place my luggage on the belt. After a few seconds, my luggage was gone and she did not tag the bag. I stayed and waited at the line for over two hours while she ""claimed"" they were looking for my luggage. She actually blamed me in part because she stated she did not have eyes in the back of her head. I did not speak any Italian so I know she said so not nice words to her coworkers. After two hours waiting, she came up to me and said they found my bag and had a green luggage tag printed out. I said good then she said I still had to pay $40. I was shocked. At no time did she apologize. So I am in Greece with no luggage for over a week. I went on a Cruise with one outfit, luckily my roommate let me borrow a dress. The hotel staff in Athens provided me with tooth brush and tooth paste. My entire vacation was ruined because of the ticket person lying and said they found my luggage. Fast forward to September 4th, I flew back to Rome since my trip was over and went to every Terminal in the Rome airport. I actually found my luggage myself. I was determined to find my luggage and guess where it was located - in the untagged storage space in Terminal 3!",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Athens to London with Aegean Airlines, very friendly and professional staff. Nice plane and seats and overall no problems on the surface. The flight was enjoyable as well as my ground service.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Athens to Rhodes with Aegean Airlines. The plane had to abort take off and we return to terminal and disembark. 40 minutes later we board a new plane, and snacks and drinks are provided. On arrival to Rhodes, passengers are given a letter offering a free one way trip anywhere the airline flies.  I later call the number given and the agent confirms the free of charge ticket. So I return to Athens on the 26th. Ticket and seat number emailed to me promptly. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"I had booked an Economy Ticket through Aegean Airlines.com. Which was very easy website. At my check-in it wasn't possible to sit in Economy Class because it was full, so they changed me into the Business Class. What a great experience. It was my first time in Business Class. First a drink before take off, an appetizer, hot meal that I could chose and a dessert. And before landing one spirit. Drinks as much as I wanted.  I would really recommend Aegean Airlines if you travel in Europe to Greece.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"My flight was excellent. But with every airline you fly you will find at least one disadvantage. I notice only two with this flight. One is that on this aircraft had no Inflight entertainment. The second was that the crew would not let me to film a video of the take off and landing, when on other airlines, like Swiss, they let you with no problem.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"This airline is a pleasure to fly. Courteous and professional flight attendants, clean cabins, meals and alcoholic beverages served for free on international flights, even candies distributed before take off. It seems that Aegean Airlines took a look back to the nicer days of flying and made sure to bring back all of the now-missing elements of a pleasant flying experience. Highly recommended.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Aegean Airlines really impressed me during my recent travel. Everything about the airline felt like one of the larger global carrier companies, but the exception is that it is a budget airline. From the moment I arrived at the check-in desk and had some issues with overweight luggage, the receptionist was so kind to help me and also granted me a little leniency. The plane was clean and seemed new. Both of my flights were on time. I was shocked when they served food and beverages. The staff were so nice and friendly. What's more was that the layover happened in Athens and they make it so easy to take a train to the city and enjoy for a few hours while waiting for the connecting flight. Honestly I cannot believe how little I paid for such a seamless and pleasant experience.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"On time both ways, good inflight service.  Aegean is generally a good airline and I prefer to fly with them on my bi-monthly trips between Athens and Salonica. My only quibble in terms of inflight service is the orange 'nectar' rather than juice. However, Aegean has a baggage allowance problem. To expect people on domestic flight to only take 8 kg (ie. total with handbag) is okay, but the airline does the same even on international flights. You cannot act as a budget airline unless you offer budget prices, which Aegean does not. ",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"The elegant attire of the Aegean Airlines FAs is something that brings you back to the glamorous and classy days of the early jet age (which I never experienced). Everything went really smooth and the experience from booking to collecting luggage was flawless with an excellent level of service, despite the low-cost tariff payed (Go Light ticket + individual baggage allowance). Adequately staffed in the cabin (4 FAs, even on short-haul domestic flights), above the average food and near-mint aircraft.",yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"We flew Business class and having enjoyed the outward flight 18 days earlier we were looking forward to the return flight. The lounge at Larnaca was our first disappointment but there are reviews of this on the lounge review site. The boarding was pleasant enough, the staff helpful and friendly and the seats comfortable and well spaced. My only complaint was that we had the rearmost seats of the business section and we were unfortunate enough to have small children behind us continually banging and pushing our seats. The major complaint was the food. I am sure that they had been let down by the supplier and had to find something in a hurry, especially as the food on the outward flight was very good. The starters consisted of shredded lettuce which looked to be old and mixed in with it were pieces of anchovy and a few pieces of tomato. Judging by the left overs of other passengers, I was not the only one to find this unappetising. When the mains were served, things got worse. We were given the choice of meat or fish and I opted for meat. I have no idea what this meat was, but the meat was swimming in a weak gravy amongst a lot of peas. I did try the meat but a small taste was enough. Again, the left overs on other passenger's trays told its own story. If there was a genuine problem, I wish they had told us because as it stands, if that is their normal food, our first flight with Aegean Airlines will be our last.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"This is the 5th round trip that I have done with BRU-ATH in 2015. This time I flew business, which couldn't have been better: absolutely great service, fantastic food and drinks (wines are excellent), new Airbus 320. When I fly economy, the service is equally friendly, motivated, and willing to help. They even serve food lunch/dinner for flights below 3hrs. Certainly the best airline in the region and one of the best ones in Europe.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Overall a good experience flying with Olympic [JMK to ATH] and Aegean to LHR. The inflight catering however, is not as good as it used to be. Onboard announcements sound as if they are speeded up and difficult to understand both from cabin crew and flight deck. All in all though, very happy with Aegean and Olympic. Fly with them several times a year and miles better than budget airlines operating between UK and Greece.",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"Aegean Airlines have invested in changing the crew uniforms, upgrading the website, etc. On 5 out of 5 flights in the last 2 weeks, none left on time.  The typical message you get when there is a delay is that this is due to a late arrival of the aircraft. I genuinely hope they seriously rethink how to manage the customer expectations and justify the image that they are so keen to establish. ",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"This was my second segment of my vacation to Greece using Aegean. The planes were new, ground crew professional. Flight attendants were courteous. Offered warm towels, candy and a small pre-take-off drink. The breakfast was delicious. Before landing, another round of warm towels. There is no IFE. Good seating - not formal business class seating, with the middle seat of three blocked. Downside was the 30 minute wait for luggage at Vienna.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,I flew Aegean Airlines' flight 600 to London. Boarding was pleasant and the flight departed on time. Seat legroom was generous and the seat comfortable. Cabin crew were friendly and helpful. We were served a hot meal and drinks twice. During the flight we watced a video about Greece. Finally we arrived to LHR on time. I would recommended.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Short flight from Istanbul Ataturk to Athens. Checked in via kiosk and had only carry on baggage. Very smooth process. Boarded a little late and took off late as is with most flights leaving from Ataturk Airport. On board service was very good. Meal was very acceptable. Aircraft was very clean too. It was a pleasure to fly with Aegean and I highly recommend them.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Early morning flight to Crete from Athens International. Boarding process was quick and friendly, crew were really good especially considering the time of day of the flight. Flight was quick and offloading process was really quick and easy. Had to deal with Aegean call centre to make changes to an existing booking in order to take this flight. I have to say they were the most helpful and friendly call centre I have ever dealt with. They made changes to my booking and re-routed my flights to accommodate my holiday plans while in Greece. They explained the charges and refunds very clearly and resolved the matter quickly. What a wonderful airline to deal with.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Easy check in, lounge access and boarding experience although announcements were difficult to hear from the lounge at Heraklion Airport. Inflight service was great. Crew were friendly and helpful including pilots with their announcements. Cannot fault this airline. They are simple and easy to deal with and provide a great service on super clean aircraft.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Despite the strike of Air traffic controllers I was informed of the changing schedule and they changed my ticket to a more convenient time and day. SKG to ATH was short and on time. ATH to LHR was ready to depart 5 min ahead schedule but it was a bit delayed due to air traffic congestion; the same applied over LHR. At all points the pilot informed us promptly. New aircraft, polite crews and  a comfortable business lounge in Athens (though with no spectacular view). ",yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"Boarding was a shambles. We thought we were running a bit late, and didn't arrive at the gate until 25 minutes before take off. But when we got there, a lot of people were queued and no-one was moving. We eventually got on a bus and they boarded both front and back which was good.  On board the leg room was minimal.  We got a decent sort of meal for such a short flight but they served it late, and by the time they cleaned up and went to serve hot drinks we were descending. It was adequate but hardly what I expected of an airline that seems to be quite highly rated.",no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,"I fly with Aegean Airlines whenever possible. However, last night's almost 2-hour delay will be a game changer for me. We were informed just as we were about to board that our airplane had not even arrived. This is happening at 23.20. We were asked to wait in polar conditions due to extreme air conditioning, no compensation of any type, not even water, and we were only notified of our departure time after one hour. The ground staff were nonchalant about things, completely unhelpful. ",no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"Immaculate service on the short flight from Athens to Thessaloniki. Clean, tidy interior of the cabin, good service from the Aegean staff, and a good lounge. Will continue flying Aegean, would be interesting to see a long haul offering.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Flight to Larnaca was a joy. Generous legroom, nice meals and a fantastic range of drinks to choose from. Crew was attentive and it is nice that Aegean leave the cockpit door open during boarding..",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"Flight on time, row 1 - Friendly staff and very attentive, tasting 3 course meal and wines. Only complaint, please change the welcome and inflight “sparkling Greek wine” to real champagne. Star Alliance priority bags arrived promptly at baggage carousel Heathrow.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Very good flight with Aegean. The boarding was quickly and the crew very . During the flight, we had no entertainment (no films, no flight info). The food was an olive bread with a free no-alcoholic beverage (the first was free). Very smooth landing at Heraklion.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"Brand new A320, interior spotless. Crew immaculately groomed and attentive. Flight was on time. I was impressed with my first experience of Aegean.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"I booked a premium economy ticket so I can have a suitcase and one piece of baggage. That cost ~30Euros more than the Go Light fare. Suddently as we were waiting for the boarding to start, the airline representatives announced that every person who has the Cheapest fare, can put his baggage in the compartment with no charge. I find no reason to pay extra money and being fooled with this policy. All the other provided services were far above medium, approaching excellence. I will fly again with Aegean but the ticket policy needs serious reconsideration",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"2 flights - HER to ATH (short 50 minutes) and ATH to MXP. Both went well and flights were on time. Unexpected snacks and drinks on flight. Breakfast on MXP flight. Fast check-in, friendly cabin staff and quick baggage claim.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"Managed to get my rather large luggage quickly. First flight was on time, the A321 was clean and the Flight hosts were pleasant and friendly. Hot food was served and had an overall pleasant flight. Seats were comfortable enough, they seemed to be the same as the one Lufthansa originally put on their planes and I guess everyone went with them. Arriving in Athens there was a delay of half an hour due to congested skies as its the summer peak time. Boarded on time again a friendly staff with a good plane. They are a great choice.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"I recently flew to Mykonos through Athens and must say it was a very pleasant experience. The Zurich - Athens - Zurich legs were in Business class, to which I was upgraded for free being a Gold Member of their program Miles and Bonus. During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase. But I guess that's more a matter of the airport than the airline.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"We flew on flights 4441 and 4440 on 22nd June and 29th June. Both flights were excellent, smooth, cabin staff immaculately dressed and professional. I would use this airline again. Perhaps a free snack like a sandwich or crackers and cheese would enhance the experience.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"I am always impressed with the pleasant attitude, responsive service and  warmth of cabin crew. The ground service is good, and the food is on the good side. On the other hand, most of their planes are starting to show their age and sometimes the seats are really worn out.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,"A good flight, on time. Flight attendants were pleasant and friendy. Was traveing with my partner, we got bored halfway through the flight as there is no inflight entertainment system. Hot food was served, overall a positive experience.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"We flew Heathrow-Athens return and Athens-Santorini. The entire experience was very good. We were a bit delayed on our return flight to Heathrow and were continually updated on progress. The seats were comfortable and not tight. A hot meal was served in flight - no fee and a beverage was even included. This was on a three hour flight - a really nice touch. Unfortunately, my gluten free meal which had been ordered was not on board but the flight attendant provided a very nice salad and a sincere apology. All in all, we had a very enjoyable flight each time.",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Very good flight, nice to be offered a hot meal on the ARN-ATH leg with complimentary drinks (two rounds), nice and rather spacious seats and legroom on the ARN-ATH leg, On the ATH-JTK / JTK-ATH Leg they used a A321 with cramped max tight config so almost no legroom, but it is a very short flight so it was ok, only a small snack, no drinks but I dont think they would have time to serve on this short flight. ATH-ARN was again great legroom and also served a hot breakfast. For what we pay it is great value, far better than many other competing airlines, the planes are also new and clean. Only drawback is that there is no entertainment provided on the 3 hr flight, why not show a movie?",yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Return LHR-ATH.  Clean, plane seemed quite new.  Staff are friendly and multi-lingual (at least 3 languages on top of Greek).  Food is well above average and so is legroom.  But bring a book or some entertainment - no in-flight entertainment on this 3.5 hour flight.  But overall, I was very impressed. Would happily fly with them again and recommend to friends.",yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Multiple trip with AE between SKG-FRA and MUC. Aircraft's were always clean service was fine food above average and quite good compared to other regular European airlines and the staff was always courteous and friendly. There were only couple times out of the last maybe 30 round trips the flight was delayed and that happened summertime when the European skies are congested. I have great respect for this airline and how nicely developed to become one of the best regional airlines of Europe.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Flew from Athens to Santorini and back. Flight was an hour late leaving Athens due to congestion at Santorini return was 30 minutes late. Cabin was very clean crew friendly and impressed that a snack was offered onboard when returning to Athens. Due to turbulence when flying to Santorini the crew could not offer the inflight service so this was handed out when leaving the aircraft. Traveled with 6 month old baby and our bags got priority tags so this sped up the airport experience. Overall an excellent airline and would like to experience them on a longer journey.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Athens to Corfu on Olympic Air Bombardier Dash400-8 series aircraft (A3 402). Corfu to Athens on Aegean Airbus A320 aircraft (A3 405). Excellent service very clean cabin flights on time and smiling staff.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH return. Plenty of legroom - better than some intercontinental I have been on. Food was OK; a little on the plain side. Service was very good and superbly efficient despite both flights being at capacity but the crew could smile a little more. At least as good as BA and a step up from KLM AF or Lufthansa for regional flights - very pleasantly surprised.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Traveled on 27 May from Zurich to Larnaca on business class. Check-in (mobile) fast and uncomplicated. Airline flew on time crew was very friendly and caring food and beverages were excellent. Information provided from crew was clear and continuous. Overall a very pleasant experience.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Flew CPH-ATH on May 21 economy class. Nice airline that provides you a free meal and full bar service. The dinner consisted of tasty pasta with minced meat and a small biscuit for dessert and considering that you normally get zero for free these days in Europe it was very pleasant! Clean aircraft good information and attentive service will definitively fly Aegean again!,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Flew from Athens to Brussels. Aircraft was very clean and well maintained. Cabin crew were immaculately smartly turned out and friendly. In flight food was good quality. Pretty comfortable seats. No inflight entertainment though.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Athens-Prague on 11 May. Online check-in was quick just had to get boarding passes and to drop off bags at the airport. Despite having a bus gate boarding was organised very well and the flight departed ahead of schedule. The seats were quite comfortable and legroom was acceptable for this short flight. There was a small hot meal of pasta on the flight as well as a small dessert and drinks. Sweets were distributed before the main meal service. The red wine served on board was very good. Of note are the cabin crew who were very friendly and went around their work with smiles on their faces - this is rare these days with most airlines. The entertainment consisted of short videos on Greek island destinations and was ok though there was no audio available. Arrival into Prague on time and bags were processed within 15 minutes after leaving the aircraft. All in all Aegean is a hidden gem of an airline - I had a very good experience with Aegean and I would be glad to fly them again when I can.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,"Flew Istanbul to Athens for a connection to Santorini. Flights were all on time and the crew were great. They were short flights so no inflight entertainment and only a drink which was all that was needed. On our landing in Santorini we did a ""go around"". About 50feet from a touchdown the pilot powered up and off we went. The pilot came on the PA and advised us of a change in wind direction and all was good. First time for me and very exciting. Great that the pilot kept us up to date and well informed. Quick boarding and the bags were on the conveyer within minutes of us waiting for them.",yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH-BRU (March 2015). The flight was as it should be very friendly and helpful crew the flight was on time despite the fact was almost full. The breakfast was quite good in quantity with the only handicap the taste of the Greek 'tyropita' wasn't so equally tasty as a traditional cheese pie. Thoroughly clean and new aircraft. I will fly with them definitely next time.,yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,A3 930 Athens to Cairo. Service bland and erratic uncomfortable thin seats food inedible and in minuscule quantities. Gate agent checking my visa requirements for 15 minutes. A real disappointment.,no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,TXL-ATH-CHQ (Chania Crete) and return in March 2014. New slim line seats with hard seatback and short cushion that doesn't properly support thighs so you are forced to sit in a very unnatural and cramped position. The further back on the plane the smaller legroom gets i.e. new seats + seat in the back = nightmare while older seats in front of the cabin are very comfortable. Apart from that pleasant flights with good service hot pasta meal on TXL-ATH small though but at least one of the few remaining airlines to serve warm meals on intra- european flights. Even on the short ATH-CHQ hop they serve drinks and a cake. As they charge extra fees for every checked bag people carrying incredible amounts of luggage into the cabin making boarding a bit chaotic. Cabin baggage restrictions should be enforced.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Heathrow to Thessaloniki via Athens. Stress free check in at the new Terminal Two at Heathrow. Comfortable flight with adequate inflight hospitality with very friendly crew on all flights. Baggage checked through to our final destination and seamless transfer of flights in Athens. Clean and new Airbus A321/320 on all flights. Excellent experience would definitely fly them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,TLV-SKG with stop in LAR (Laranca) SKG-TLV with stop in ATH 17/3  TLV-LAR leg Airbus 320-200 with excellent leg room no refreshments no entertainment (short flight) on time very efficient crew. 17/3 LAR-SKG on time Airbus 320-200 small leg room hard seats not comfortable very poor meal. 19/3 SGK-ATH on time Airbus 320-200 small leg room hard seats  not comfortable no entertainment (short flight). 19/3 ATH-TLV. Small delay Airbus 320 with excellent leg room very poor meal efficient crew. Clean aircraft's on all flights.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,I flew 2 times this month from Zurich to Athens and back and I must say that I'm really glad this airline has included Switzerland to its destinations. I always left and arrived on time the crew was very friendly and professional and I found the inflight magazine interesting to read. Aegean definitely is one of my favourite airlines.,yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,Athens to Abu Dhabi Business. Business class is a waste of money. There is the middle seat which is not available thus giving more room to the other 2 side passengers. No comfort seats no video system no amenities no nothing. Food was just ok stuff was kind and helpful. My advice: Beware of Aegean flights out of Europe as these are just seasonal. If they find that they have many empty seats left they will cancel the flight. I should fly Etihad economy. Its cheaper than Aegean business more reliable and has the same amenities except food.,no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,I booked to Abu Dhabi Business. One month before departure they informed me that my returned flight was canceled because Aegean had canceled all Abu Dhabi flights after November. I asked for a replacement ticket with their partner Etihad but they told me they can't do that. So they gave me some money back and made me buy another return ticket for 300 euros. The business class has little to do with business class. Apart from the food it looks like economy class. The only difference is that there is a reclined table at the middle seat shared by the two side passengers. No personal entertainment system either just newspapers. I have noticed that many routes are operated by Aegean only seasonally so beware they may cancel your flight anytime if they see that they have not many reservations. Overall definitely a budget airline nothing more.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,I flew to Heraklion and Aantorini from Athens in February. Seats are fine with decent leg room unfortunately there's no proper inflight entertainment on the flight. The service carried out by the cabin crew are professional and efficient. My return flight from Heraklion was delayed due to some technical difficulties. But we still managed to arrive in Athens on time. My flight to Santorini was short so they couldn't really carry out the full service but they still manage to give us cookies and fresheners. I would definitely take Aegean again on my next journey to Greece.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Traveled on February 20th from Athens to Larnaca on Flight A3-908. I must say that the professionalism of the cabin crew was excellent. Although the flight was very short the cabin crew were smiling warm hearted to everyone and even at a time when they had to deal with a passenger that was demanding for more and more alcohol the cabin crew dealt with it with professionalism defusing the situation without embarrassing the passenger. I would definitely choose Aegean again for my trips.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,LHR-ATH-CHQ Return 13th February 2015 - 21st February 2015. I got the 22.15 flight from Heathrow to Athens on the 13th and then the 09.15 flight to Chania on the 14th. At Heathrow the flight was over-subscribed so they were offering people a large sum of money a night in a hotel and the flight the following day - I wish they would have asked me! Then they were asking people to (voluntarily) check their hand luggage into the hold - so I offered because of the long wait I had at ATH! The flight was smooth the hot meal was served early on into the flight and we landed slightly early. The only criticisms I have is that the seats are a little hard and the cabin was stiflingly hot and very bright! Great to have a free meal though. On arrival at Athens at 03.40 I collected my hand luggage and checked into an airport lounge before my flight to Chania - which was well worth the £20! Flight to Chania was a bit poorly organised but landed on time. Return flights were also very good and a mercifully shorter stop over in Athens!,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,FRA-SKG Business class. Seat was standard European Business class seat (same as Economy class and middle seat was blocked). 3 course menu with Greek wines. They have standard coffee cappuccino espresso also. I was eating 70min of the 150 min flight! They have a only business class passengers bus between parking spots and the terminal.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,Writing this on behalf of my 87yr old mother who had flown to the UK on a 6 wk trip to see family. Aegean had been informed she required a wheelchair and we received confirmation it was booked both ways. From Rhodes to London they had no details regarding the chair and had to rush around looking for one. Apart from that initial problem my mother informed me everything was fine however on the day of her return Aegean decided to go on strike thankfully they messaged although it was 10 'o' clock at night. I tried desperately to get through eventually they put her on the following day again with confirmation of the wheelchair. London section was fine she tells me and the staff were quite attentive but on landing at Rhodes I waited outside and to my disgust saw my poor mother dragging a 20kg suitcase behind her carrying a coat and her handbag! Not one staff member offered to help she even had to ask a member of the public to lift her case from the conveyor belt.,no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Our flight from Rhodes to Athens on route to Heathrow was cancelled with sufficient notice given. To fix this they got us tickets on Olympic leaving the same day just a couple of hours earlier. Flight from Athens to Heathrow was very pleasant and we arrived on time. Staff were all friendly and willing to assist even the office staff in regards to our cancelled flights were very helpful.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Athens to Larnaca economy. Early morning flight. Departing punctually serves simple breakfast. Crew friendly and efficient.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,MUC-SKG on 17th of Dec. One-way. New A320 with new style of seats quite uncomfortable though. Friendly and nice crew. A hot meal was served in this short flight and drinks. However passengers didn't obey at all to the new cabin baggage rules causing space problems and minor delays and the crew did nothing about it. Rules should be more strictly enforced.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew London to Athens and then on to Ioannina and then from Ioannina to Athens and back to London. Great flight new and comfortable planes professional crew good meals and snacks. Great airline with great product. When and if I ever go to Greece again I will fly with Aegean.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,FCO-ATH-LCA-ATH all in business as using points. Easy check-in. Quality of meals and wine excellent for short . flights. Attentive staff -although as first two flights only 3 of us out of possible 8 to be expected. Really did run a separate bus on arrival for just 3 business class passengers at ATH and LCA.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,I had a flight on October 14 going from ATH to HER and back upgrading my economy ticket to business by spending some miles on the aegean miles program. I had an excellent light meal the personnel of the aircraft was gentle and smiley. The seat was the same like the economy class but it was comfortable enough.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,I flew on October 5th then on to Mykonos. I then flew to Athens and then to Kos. On the 16th from Kalymnos to Athens and back to Mykonos and then on 22nd Mykonos - Athens - to Irakio Crete and then from Crete back to Athens. I must say I have had some excellent flights with Aegean. All flights on time and an excellent meal from London to Athens and this being Economy. On the internal flights you were offered a soft drink and snack. Cabin crews were extremely professional and I look forward to next October. The only downside is that: 1) They did not show any films or music available on the London flight and 2) When I booked in March I could not book the November flight home because tickets were not available so BA flew me home. I knocked a point off their food and beverages as they don't serve a gin and tonic in Economy. AS I have said I look forward to flying with them next year but they have changed the flight times to Mykonos from Athens from 7 pm to 6.30 pm which makes life difficult so they might lose this customer.,yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,I have travelled from Athens to Tirana every week for the past two years and I see it more as a torture rather than a journey. It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30’mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat. Finally this journey costs only 260 euro (return) if you don't check in any luggage otherwise you have to add roughly 80 euro to the price.,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,A3600 14/10/2014 Athens to London and return 22/10/2014 A3603. Me and my family have been using Aegean Airlines for years and we have always been happy with the service. I was disappointed to find out that they have stopped playing movies during flights. On my return flight from Athens to London last week there was entertainment system at all. No music no movies. I think this is the last time I will use Aegean. Very boring flight.,no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,Munich to Thessaloniki. 17/10/2014. No space to place a laptop in cabin due to people with more hand luggage than allowed. Crew not friendly and not willing to apply the rules of hand luggage per person. Food below average. Drinks warm. This wasn't the first time things where not good. Would avoid flying with Aegean again if possible.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,This was my third flight with Aegean in the last three years. I had pleasant experiences with my other two but wanted to reconfirm consistency before I rated this airline. Travelled LHR to ATH this time. Plane was clean and comfortable (for a 3 hour or so flight). My compliments to the staff. As in past flights they very pleasant warm and professional. Food served was as good as can be expected.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Kos-Athens-LHR on October 1st at 19.10hrs. Very professional service. The airline offered sweets on take-off small snack and drink on Kos-Athens which is just a 40 minute flight! The drinks service are repeated twice on Athens-LHR flight and the meals are adequate. Well worth £70 one way and into Heathrow! I would definitely fly them again. Seating is okay for 3 hours 30 minutes and flight seems to go fast as the cabin crew are constantly busy with the passengers. Probably a budget IFE system needs adding for a little more enjoyment!,yes

Aegean Airlines,3/10,I travel with Aegean many times during the year usually I do SKG-ATH-SKG and I usually travel in business not because of the service but because I have the ability to change flights at will online and without any extra charge. During my last trip to Athens for the outbound flight they put two flights together - as a result I was not able to change flights online. Hence I had to call them up in order to change flights they inform that I had to pay an extra 65 euros if I wanted to fly in a particular flight and 20 euro if I wanted to fly with another flight. I told them that this is a business ticket and I can change whenever I want to the could not care less. Hence I have decided not to fly with them again.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,MAD-ATH-JMK return. The only downside is that all flights departed a minimum of 30 mins late. On the good side: check in fast and easy nice clean and comfortable aircraft. Great attentive FA food served all sectors along with drinks. Baggage short on belt after arrival. Will fly them back to Greece.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Traveled on Aegean twice this week ATH-HER RT and ATH-MAD. All flights on time crews were polite and professional. I fly economy everywhere and expect uncomfortable seats (they were) but while I don't like it realize that's the way economy is so if flights are on time I'm satisfied. Aegean even supplied a meal in coach for the ATH-MAD flight which no USA airline does. I would fly again with Aegean and recommend.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Rome to Athens June 23 2014. Flight was on-time comfortable seat spacing nice meal friendly and attentive staff. Would fly them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Travelled with Aegean Airlines from Barcelona to Athens. Flight was delayed leaving Barcelona however still managed to arrive in Athens on time. Excellent cabin service provided by attentive and polite flight attendants. Can't complain especially with the hot meal and free alcoholic beverage provided in economy class. Wish Aegean offered long haul routes to North America!,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,You go up. You go down. Flight is over. This 20 min flight from Athens to Mykonos on an A320 does what it needs to do get you to your destination.,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,"25/8/2014 A3 381 19.55 (L). I was checked in for 4A. It was impossible to see the screens which showed the ""safety briefing'"". I think the business class curtains prevented us from seeing the screen. A design problem and very important.",yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,Travelling from Athens to Santorini in August 2014. Flight was delayed. Not enough seats in airport lounge. No drinks provided. Only given a cookie. Travellers allowed to take extra hand luggage onto flight so there was not enough room for people who only had the one designated bag. We then had our return flight - we called the airline and asked if possible could we get on an earlier flight back to Athens if there were sears available. We were told seats were available most of the earlier flights however it would cost us euro 112 per person to catch the earlier flight. Offered us a 20% discount on a full new fare. Online price was only euro 117 to 131. We had initially purchased the two seats for euro 300. This spoilt our European vacation. We could understand a small penalty to changed however to charge a complete new ticket when there were empty seats available and there are numerous flights back and forth from Santorini to Athens.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,MUC-SKG A3 503 July 22. Efficient check-in use of Lufthansa Business Class lounge (chaotic). Aircraft gate at the far end of the terminal had to walk a lot. Aircraft A320 smart neat clean. Cockpit briefing rather informative. Business class cabin crew (one flying attendant dedicated to four passengers) very satisfactory polite communicative professional. Seating pitch satisfactory - mediocre width (middle seat unoccupied - turned to table). Lavatory clean. Full satisfactory hot meal (choice of main course) with a Mediterranean accent freshly brewed espresso coffee. Actually no in flight entertainment - drop down overhead TV screens with safety instructions and flight path information. Arrived on time business class passengers departed first and transported to the terminal with a dedicated bus. Baggage (Priority labelled) were the first to arrive. Aegean airlines is rightfully voted as one of Europe's top regional airlines.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,JIK-ATH-LHR on 11 August 2014. Return flight after week in Ikaria. Aegean flight left a few minutes late but made up time although sadly had to stack for 45 minutes at Heathrow. Excellent legroom and seat comfort. Pleasantly surprised with the quality of the meal provided and the drinks so much more than so-called cheaper airlines. Would definitely fly Aegean again. Only downside was the failure of UK Border Agency to have sufficient staff at the immigration desks at Terminal 2.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Domestic flights: Athens-Kerkira (Corfu) on a A319 aircraft and Ioannina-Athens on a Bombardier DHC-8-400Q (operated by Olympic Air). Excellent service on-time performance and very polite staff.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,JMK-ATH-LHR. A3 377/A3 608 7 Aug 2014. Mykonos - Athens sector operated by Olympic Air Dash 800 aircraft. Clean inside and out and welcomed on board by very polite cabin crew. Only 2 Flight Attendants for a 20 minute flight. Departed on time and despite the fact that it was such a short flight a full drink service was offered with a variety of soft drinks napkins ice and a bag of peanuts and everyone was served. Upon landing in ATH the goodbye and thanks you greeting was polite with a smile. An excellent flight. 3 hour layover at Eleftherios Venizelos International Airport Athens was a breeze. Was given an invite to the Aegean Business Lounge on the A side of the departure terminal which was comfortable with the usual drinks and snacks available and regularly topped up. Nice clean lounge with a view of both runways. ATH-LHR Aegean Business. Departed ATH with 15 minute delay clean Airbus A321-200 aircraft. Good PA announcements by Purser and Captain. Comfortable leather seats with middle seat free. Drink service and peanuts after take off with hot towel service. Menu was provided with a choice of 2 hot main meals of chicken or swordfish with a delicious salmon entree and a selection of delicious Greek desserts. A good choice of wines including award winning Greek varieties plus the usual soft after dinner and a good selection of teas and coffees. Hot towel service again before landing. Landed on time. A very impressive service offered by Aegean. Have no hesitation about using them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,LHR-ATH-LHR. Flight over very uncomfortable as it was a smaller plane than usual and absolutely no leg room. No inflight entertainment which is essential for a nervous flyer. Seating comfort was better on return trip but Aegean have ceased inflight films and replaced them with extremely repetitive tourist films and no radio/music. Very disappointing. Having flown with Aegean on this route for many years I am now reconsidering.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew from Rome FCO to ATH 2 hour flight but had a large selection of drinks lovely meal then tea or coffee after dinner. The staff were charming and helpful no delays at all the check in staff were informative and efficient telling us where to go with our rucksacks (apparently they're awkward shape so go in the 'oversized baggage' section). We were so efficient getting off the plane we beat our luggage to the conveyor belt. Would definitely recommend this airline to anyone.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,"I am a Senator Gold frequent flier with Star Alliance. I bought a ticket with Aegean to Paros. It turns out that the flight is operated by Olympic Air - not a Star Alliance member - and therefore some of my privileges do not apply. I can still have more luggage but I can not use the lounge. The Aegean representative refused to issue an invitation to the Aegean lounge since ""it would cost them extra money"" while I thought I had this privilege included in my ticket bought with Aegean. Nothing about reduced privileges was mentioned when I bought the ticket. Aegean did not want to do anything to accommodate the urgent need of a passenger with a Senator Gold card of Star Alliance who had to use the internet in their lounge for an emergency.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Madrid - Mykonos with a change of plane in Athens we left Madrid just after midnight. The plane was new and clean the service was excellent and what a treat to have a hot meal on a European flight. On leaving the plane at Athens we were told to contact the ground staff immediately as we had a very short connection time. We did so and the ground staff sent us onto the same bus as everybody else! Luckily the airport was not busy at 5 a.m. and we easily caught the flight to Mykonos. However a good very short flight to Mykonos and Aegean cannot be blamed for the ground crew. I would happily fly with them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,Birmingham to Rhodes 5th July. Absolutely appalling. 12 hour delay with no update through-out the day. No explanation or apology when we eventually got on the flight. Once we were on the flight the toilets were locked at the front and we couldn't get past the air hostesses to use the toilets at the back. States in Aegan Airlines T&C of delayed flights that we are meant to get some form of contact from the airline within 7 days. 3 weeks later we still have yet to hear from them.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,BUD-ATH-JTR and back with a stopover. Nice surprise! Clean new aircraft (A320/A321) and the BUD-ATH sector even had a hot meal you don't see that so much today. Had to pay for my luggage in JTR agent was very polite so no problem. Will definitely not hesitate to fly them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Flew MXP-ATH-KGS and back with Aegean in mid-May. After being used to the service quality of US flights I was pretty impressed with their service. Light meals were served on each leg of the flight the crew were friendly and though only the route map was provided as entertainment it was all I needed so I was satisfied with that as well. Would recommend this airline for people traveling to/from/within Greece.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,Rhodes to Birmingham Saturday 5th July. Over eleven hours late with no explanation other than 'technical problems'. It should have left after nine hours but no staff were on duty to keep us informed and a 7.30 am flight finally took off at 7.16pm. The staff were miserable and surly. No route map on the inflight and the front toilet locked on both journeys.,no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,Flew London Heathrow - Athens and back. Aegean have introduced these hopeless self check in machines. Having already checked in online and printed our boarding passes we ignored the machines at Heathrow and went straight to the desk where the assistant refused to serve us until we had used a machine. But this would not recognise our name booking reference or passport numbers. We tried again and again until eventually another member of staff sorted it for us. Not a good start as far as we were concerned I was fuming. Returning from Athens we encountered exactly the same problems with a check in machine there. This time even an assistant failed to operate the terminal and she subsequently instructed us to join a lengthy queue. Reaching the front 15 minutes later we were told we were in the wrong queue it was the Olympic desk and not Aegean which was the next one along. Our plea that we were in the queue we had been instructed to join by a member of staff was met with no sympathy whatsoever. With us on the verge of going ballistic the person at the correct desk was thankfully sympathetic and helpful. Everything on our flights was as expected though I must comment that there was less legroom than I have ever before experienced on a plane. As a tall person (5 ft 11 in / 180 cm inside leg 33 in / 84 cm) I spent the entire flight with my knees jammed firmly either side of the seat in front of me and unable to move.,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,Swiftair instead of Aegaen Rhodos to Zurich 5th July 2014. Instead an Aegean aircraft we had to board a nameless very old White MD 83. No announcements no apologies and a 2 hour delay! Onboard I found out that it was a Swiftair charter airline from Spain. Seat comfort very basic no magazines no monitors absolutely nothing. Very old noisy aircraft. I booked through the official homepage of Aegean and was very disappointed about this awful downgrading. Nevertheless the cabin Crew of Swiftair (except one Supervisor all Spaniards) did an acceptable job. The inbound flight ZRH to ATH was one hour late. But at least it was an Aegean aircraft. My next flights to Greece will be again on SWISS.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Munich-Athens-Munich. Both flights on time very clean and comfortable Airbus A320/321 planes. Beautiful well- groomed and very nice young cabin crew only hot meals served on both flights full bar service incl very nice Greek wines. Bags delivered within 20 mins. Highly recommended.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,LHR-ATH leg on Aegean Airlines Flight A3601 Economy. Check in with Aegean was a breeze professional and quick. Boarding was efficient and welcomed on board by polite and attentive crew with genuine smiles. Nice to see New Airbus A321 clean outside and spotless interior. Lunch consisted of tasty Greek meatballs with potatoes which was delicious. Greek salad as starter and a nice dessert. Tea and a choice of coffees were available and the usual soft drinks. Cabin crew were very polite and pleasant helpful and offered service with a smile. A Singapore Airlines style service. Return leg ATH-LHR was just as pleasant. Found the whole Aegean experience to be very comfortable with polite attentive crew and good service throughout. Would have no hesitation in using them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,I flew from Barcelona to Athens and from Athens to Istanbul. I had a booking through United Airlines from Houston originally travelling through Barcelona Athens Istanbul and back to Houston. However at Barcelona Airport I was informed that I had to pay 45 Euro for my baggage for the Aegean flight to Athens. The stewardess were generally rude and spoke little English on board. I will never fly them again.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-FCO 2 hours flight on time. Check-in Lounge Cabin crews all friendly and smooth operation. Complementary hot meal with pasta and soft drinks small bottle Greek wine coffee/tea. Priority luggage came out first at the FCO airport.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,Istanbul to Athens. 1.5 hour delay is unacceptable. It was my second flight delay with Aegean in just one week. Seat space and meal very poor.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,I flew from Geneva to Athens in May 2014. Crew were very polite and welcoming the service was excellent for the price. I was surprised to have a full meal and to receive an alcoholic drink for free for such a low ticket price. I flew back with a low cost airline from Thessaloniki…the ticket was more expensive and of course nothing was offered to eat or drink. I was also surprised to see how fast and easy it is to upgrade in their miles and bonus program. I have already booked my next flight with them.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Athens - Brussels - Athens. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Good food on time.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Athens - Brussels - Athens. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Good food on time.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,"The best idea if you have to fly with them is not to understand Greek: then you will not understand the check-in staff talking amongst themselves! Also you will not understand the stewardess instructing another on the safety procedures and features of the plane (""no this is the call button it does not sound an alarm""). On the LHR-ATH flight they failed to carry out basic safety procedures like drawing back partitions and ensuring all seat belts were fastened. On the ATH-LHR leg I was informed that I had to pay an extra 45 euro for the same bag that was included in the outward ticket!",no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,Adding a 25% extra luggage fee to the already expensive ticket is outrageous. We traveled each with 16Kg normal luggage from Brussels to Greece and back. We carried small back packs as hand luggage. Before we were allowed to check in we were charged 45 euros for each suit case. One would think that charging 190 euros (going and back) extra for luggage is obscenely greedy.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,A321 and A320 Kos - Athens / Athens - Vienna May 3 2014. Nice service friendly staff clean and comfortable seats. Simple and useful online check-in.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,First flight with Aegean Airlines and found it all very relaxing. The staff were friendly and helpful and tried to give the personal touch. From the moment we checked our bags in we found them to be really helpful. I was very nervous about the stay over and catching the next flight from ATH to RHO but they really reassured me and made sure I felt happy. On arrival in ATH they made the change of flight very stress free. Definitely use them again. So much different to Ryanair who were dreadful.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,I had a reward booking with them from ATH to LHR and on a separate ticket I had a paid ticket from CHQ to ATH. They had it as valid connection the CHQ-ATH at 17.25 arriving in ATH at 18.10 and then 19.10 - 21.00 onwards to LHR. The feeder flight got delayed by an hour resulting to almost lose the connecting flight. Upon boarding I inform the crew but they were indifferent. Finally I did manage to catch my connecting flight only because there were others delayed as well.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,I was booked on an evening flight from Santorini to Athens but arrived very late and after closure of the check-in desk. I expected the worst that is to be refused boarding but I was so impressed that the Aegean staff agreed to check me in opened the check-in desk and helped me to join the other boarding passengers very efficiently. Full marks for flexibility without compromising security or delaying the flight and that extra effort made such a difference and saved me from a nightmarish situation of cancelled onward flights and hotel. The flight itself was also very stress-free and the hostesses were polite and friendly. Very nice airline.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,"Not surprising this is a ""regional"" airline and it obviously aspires to nothing better! In Oct.2013 I booked and paid for a business class seat ATH-MAN but 3 weeks ago while checking My Bookings noticed I'd been downgraded to economy. The call centre simply shifted the blame to the travel agent. The latter found out that Aegean have decided not to offer business class on this route no warning no alternatives nothing. I cancelled my ticket.",no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,"ATH-MUC in economy in March 2014 economy has the dreaded ""slimline"" seats that LH started and everyone seems to be following. That said flight crew was pleasant and professional airplane was clean flight landed on time- Aegean even gives you a snack and a drink on this flights. Pleasant experience would recommend.",yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,Rome FCO - Athens A3651 Feb 22nd. Athens - Rhodes A3216 Feb 22nd. This airline is intended to be a regular airline however it behaves like a low-cost one. You have to pay to check in a luggage in addition to the normal fare. Seat spacing is comparable to a low cost such as Ryanair quite insufficient. Food is average but more importantly it is presented in cardboard boxes which are recycled. Choice of beverages is very limited. Unfortunately Aegean is in a monopolistic situation in Greece and they are expensive and cost/satisfaction of service is below average.,no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,LCA-ATH-BRU: Very average experience. Flying from Larnaca to Athens flight arrived on time to the destination seat space was ok food was horrible. Inflight service very average. Nobody expects anything special flying economy regarding food but what Aegean served for breakfast was beyond words. A tasteless omelette there was liquid coming out of it plus a small chocolate. The second segment of my flight from Athens to Brussels was better in leg space service and food but I find unacceptable the control they have on hand luggage. Lately they introduced the low fare tickets for people travelling with just hand luggage people of course try to benefit from this. Passengers carry in the cabin what they would otherwise have checked at the check in counters! What is happening is that people carry oversized suitcases and try to fit them in the overhead storage holders and I was really surprised to see that they allow this. I was carrying a 6 kg soft handbag which I placed in the overhead holder above my seat and the air hostess asked me if she could move it in a holder further in the other row simply to fit a big suitcase! The most positive aspect to this airline is the convenient times.,yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,Aegean is really unpredictable. Can be excellent in every way or disappointing in many other ways. For example though their fares are in no way low cost they started charging 20 euros for a piece of luggage each way (short haul) and 30 euros for longer flights i.e. to Spain. BA and CY do not charge. Going out to BCN cost me for 2 pax 95 euros more than for our return flight on Vueling. Of course Vueling offers no breakfast (you have to pay for it) yet breakfast on Aegean was as poor as you can imagine. Yes on this flight they used the good jet steps and not their favourite bus transport to - from aircraft. One thing that is really impressive is the inflight attendants exceptionally professional.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Took 2 flights with Aegean Airlines in December 2013 and was truly impressed. Their quality of service was a long way ahead of British Airways that I used on 4 other flights and I will look at using Aegean Airlines again on my next trip to Europe - if Athens is on the trip list!,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,BRU to Athens on 11 Jan 2014 and flight A3622 from Athens to BRU on 15 Jan 2014. First time experience with Aegean Airlines was very pleasurable from good online check-in mobile boarding card on time departures friendly patient cabin crew and service oriented ground staff.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Athens-Dusseldorf. Pleasant flight catering could be better. The negative part was the ground staff (at the gate): they changed without asking us the flight by transferring us to the next flight.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,We booked and paid for a package in May 2013 to fly to Munich in Dec 2013. Flight out was with Lufthansa which was great. However when we tried to check in online the day before our return to Cyprus with Aegean through Athens we got an error message saying 'non valid ticket' and giving us a number to call. We called the number which was Lufthansa and the agent told us he could see our booking but couldn't check us in as the computer systems weren't compatible. We tried the Aegean online check in but still no joy. So we got to Munich airport 2.5 hours before our flight to check in only to be told we were on standby! We were assured that the gate personnel would sort it out to our satisfaction so we went through to the departure gates. The departure gate had changed but not updated on the terminal screen. When we finally found it the staff were very off hand about us being on standby even though we couldn't understand how we didn't have a seat when the whole thing had been booked and paid for 7 months earlier. After making a big fuss and having to wait until 5 mins before take off we finally managed to get on the plane but not seated together. Another passenger offered to swap seats so we did sit together in the end. Unfortunately we were supposed to transfer in Athens and were very concerned that we would have to go through the whole thing again and we actually refused to board the Athens plane until we were sure we had seats on the Athens to Cyprus plane. No acceptable explanation was given as to why we had been given the run-around and in fact we were made to feel that we were just making a fuss about nothing. The service on board was indifferent food was shoddy and we will never fly with Aegean again. We've flown a lot long and short haul and I can safely say this was the worst experience ever.,no
Aegean Airlines,6/10,Although I have been rooting for Aegean in the past these past months I have traveled RHO-ATH-RHO many times and each time the experience seems to be worsening. The boarding and flight schedules are perfectly fine if you ignore the constant use of a bus for boarding instead of jumping platforms in Athens but the cabin experience apart from the seat comfort which is ok is worse every time. The take off is usually ok. The trip to Rhodes lasts for approximately 50 minutes and the cabin crew are struggling to serve you. It looks as if with one hand they serve and with the other they collect what they have just served for landing. The crew are typically indifferent and tend not to smile. The catering is average but couldn't expect big things for a 50 minute flight. For now it progressively costs more money to travel with Aegean that what you actually get in return at least for these domestic routes.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,Awful Aegean experience (Heathrow to Athens on 22nd December 2013): Hand-luggage with just two laptops (one of them half size) is overweight for Aegean airlines. Hand-luggage bought especially for cabin use and used in others budget airlines with no problem. They made me to empty it twice! For a ticket bought 9 months ago at a price of £ £420 for a flight equivalent to 3.40 hours. The plane was delayed an hour. I just managed to get my next connection flight to Mytilini because it operates from the same airline and they were waiting for us. Aegean has monopolised the local aviation. Also the time schedule is such that it is not worth it to get another airline and change to Aegean for the local trip only.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,First time flying with Aegean Airlines from FRA to ATH on a Lufthansa codeshare and couldn't be happier. Nice to have inflight infotainment on a short haul flight and not bad food better than Air Canada. No delays on time and cabin crew were nice. Only downside was that there was no seat-back monitors which many airliners are upgrading to and seats are sort of stiff.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,ATH-ROM-ATH. Great airline with great service and great staff. The trip was perfect despite the bad weather.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,I have now been flying with Aegean since they took over the Olympic slots at Heathrow. This year on the morning of October 7th Heathrow was fog bound so the flight to Athens was delayed by two hours. This meant missing the evening flight to Mykonos. As soon as I was checking in their staff were most helpful. On arriving at Athens I was put up in Hotel Sofitel everything paid for and caught the flight to Mykonos the following morning. My only thought is that the evening flight to Mykonos is too tight with the London flight around about an hour and needs looking in to. Aegean is an excellent airline as part of my holiday flew with them to Crete as well all flights were full and I look forward to flying with them next October.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Manchester-Athens Oct 2013. Boarding and landing was 20 minutes delayed. Very comfortable seats and excellent staff. Food was really good and you could choose from a variety of drinks. Overall a very good flying experience. The only thing i would like to stress is the lack of any entertainment. I don't know if it is so expensive to show a movie during the flight especially when the screens are available! An airline like Aegean should at least have some kind of entertainment for long flights.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,We flew 3 times with this airline and all flights were great even though there were delays (up to 20 minutes ) all arrivals were on time . The first flight from Kiev to Athens the plane was a brand new Airbus A320 leather seats in the cabin and very comfortable. Take-off and landing were perfect the staff were normal. For food I do not intend to complain on a flight less than 3 hours. In general we were impressed with this airline and we can recommend it.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,My wife and I flew from Rome to Athens and Athens to Paris recently check in was a breeze and both flights were great. No problems at all.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH-RHO and return October 2013. Checked in online for all flights and seat assignments honoured. Flights arrived on time or early. Boarding a little chaotic despite very strict adherence to boarding by rows. No queue jumping was allowed if your row hadn't been called you were not allowed to board. Yet somehow chaos and confusion reigned in the cabin partly because of the amount of hand luggage some passengers had been allowed to take on board and partly because every single flight was packed solid. In flight service was excellent if a little slow. Hot meals served on international flights (ok quality) free (and good) Greek wine available and refills willingly given. Fight attendants universally pleasant and service oriented. A321 on international flights with inflight entertainment on drop down screens. A320 on domestic service. Check in at LHR and RHO easy and quick. Baggage delivery prompt. All in all very pleasant.,yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"London Stansted-Athens-Thessaloniki. Once again although cabin experience with this airline is good check-in process seems to be its weak point. Flight departed Stansted on time but just before landing at Athens I realised that I did not have a boarding pass for the connecting flight. I spoke to cabin crew about it but they seemed unaware of any issues/processes and simply referred me to the connecting flight desk at the airport. When I got there this was shut. There was no one available from the airline either and I ended up speaking to airport security. I was told that I had to come out of the airport security controlled area and check in all over again to get the boarding pass and that this is a standard procedure even though bags get transferred on to next flight automatically. There was a queue from hell at check-in which seems to be the norm for Aegean. I have never been asked to check in twice at airport for connecting flights. This then caused problems with my airport shopping not getting through security and I had to pick up my bag re-pack and hand in again. This involved a long and time- consuming process walking up and down the airport's different floors etc. Ground staff were understanding and did their best to help but there is no two ways about it: this was a very poorly ""organised"" connecting flight. I sent a form to customer service to complain but they just said that the problem was at Stansted and that they have rectified it. I asked how they have rectified it but they just responded by repeating the same. I am not convinced. A hassle-free flight with Aegean seems impossible and the overall experience does not correspond to what you pay. I would not recommend. On the way back with Air Berlin connecting at Dusseldorf did not give any problems and was a pleasure to walk past the Aegean packed check-in area knowing I didn't have to brave it.",no
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,The short flight from Athens to Istanbul was delayed by 1.5 hrs making my fiancé and I miss our connecting flights back to Singapore. We were stranded in Istanbul airport for 12 hours with no offer of food or drink and no concrete solution from Aegean. Eventually at 3am the morning we were given a hotel. We slept for 4 hours. We then rushed back to the airport the next morning finally guaranteed a flight and arrived back just in time for work on Monday 6am. We were suppose to be there the previous morning (Sunday). Aegean made no effort to book us decent seats leaving us to sit apart the entire journey home as a result I didn't sleep at all during the flight. Therefore I had 4 hours sleep in 48 hours and had to go straight in to work. The representative also lied to us to keep us happy until we left and could do nothing about it. We tried to call him but he refused to take our calls. The plane was really nice and comfy seats but the pilot nearly crashed upon landing. I would suspect that the reason the flight was delayed in the first place was that there was no pilot thus a stand-in pilot was used.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-HER-ATH connecting to Swiss ZRH-ATH-ZRH. Short 50 min flight on a A321. Flight completely full however the friendly crew managed to serve the whole plane drinks and peanuts. Very comfortable seats sufficient legroom. All in all very enjoyable. Would choose Aegean again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH-PRG-ATH. All flights were smooth and on time. Check-in in Athens and Prague airport was fine and not too long. The seats on board the aircraft's were comfortable better than other airlines and the legroom was good. Inflight entertainment was nothing special. It was only the inflight map. The cabin crew and the service were very good we had a sandwich which was bigger than some other airlines with a choice of complimentary drinks for both legs. Overall Aegean Air is a very good airline as it claims to be. I would fly again with them if I have a chance. Too bad they don't fly long haul routes but they only fly regional routes.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,MUC-SKG-ATH-HER-MUC: All flights on time with smiles clean aircraft and decent catering. Overall impeccable and a pleasure to fly!,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,Having read favourable reviews of this airline I had been looking forward to my flight from Athens to LHR. The aircraft an Airbus A321 was full but loading was well organised and my economy seat had decent legroom although was on the hard side. I was looking forward to my usual gin and tonic and was disappointed to discover that there was to be no drinks service on this four hour flight. The meal was eventually served on a chaotic tray the salad comprised small amounts of grated carrot and cabbage and the hot main was a pea and potato stew of strange flavour. The high-light of the meal was the small roll and cheese triangle! The bottle of red wine offered with the meal undrinkable. Two weeks earlier I had flown economy class LHR to Istanbul with British Airways and enjoyed the usual high standard of service I that I always seem to find on their flights.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,We flew from Athens to Rhodes 2 weeks ago fantastic airline short flight had sweets and soft drinks plenty of leg room.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,Customer service staff at Greece Airport were generally rude and sarcastic giving different versions of flight re-booking solutions. We were told we have to pay an extra 39 euros per person due to different flight cost and when we went to a different counter we were charged 20 euros per ticket as ticket amendment costs instead. In all the attitudes of the staff were very unpleasant.,no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"Return trip MUC-HER-MUC. On the return flight from Heraklion a cramped airport check-in-area full of returning holiday-makers: as a home-airport for the airline I would expect more than only one check-in being available for two simultaneously departing flights (MUC & CDG) resulting in horrible waiting queues. Additionally all passengers including those who managed to self-check-in and proceed to a ""bag-drop-desk"" had to queue a second time to take their luggage to only one open x-ray station themselves - another queuing disaster in an already overcrowded waiting hall. In total the check-in and ""bag-drop"" process on this particular flight consumed nearly two hours in cretan summer heat. I think Aegean could certainly do better by doubling the check-in-staff (opening a second counter) and making sure that passengers can actually drop their bags at the bag-drop. Making the experience even worse was a consecutive technical issue with the aircraft resulting in nearly 3 hours of waiting in an equally overcrowded terminal airside with bad information policy.",no
Aegean Airlines,6/10,I have been disappointed with this airline on many occasions especially the fact that somehow they seem to hate jetsteps and they seem to favour the good old diesel buses from plane to terminal. In June after a long flight from PHL to MUC this airline was the only one to drive us around to the plane for Athens in a bus! Recent flight from LCA on 22/8 delayed 35 minutes arrived in Athens with delay. Good old bus to terminal what a pity. Aircraft seating is rather cramped for tall guys covered with plastic leather not really good for hot climates and worst of all the sandwiches were packed full with mayonnaise. Most passengers strongly complained and threw them away. Aegean could be good if they decide to eliminate such problems and make use of modern facilities not the good old diesel bus.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,BRU-ATH ATH-BRU. Jul 20 2013 and Aug 11 2013. Aegean always exceeds expectations. Attentive and courteous cabin crew clean aircraft and comfortable seats. Above and beyond!,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,RHO-ATH-FCO. This should be listed as a 4-star airline. Clean new planes excellent meals featuring Greek items and the most courteous FA's I have encountered in years. A pleasure to fly!,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Athens to London Heathrow with A321. Very clean aircraft very helpful crew and tasty food. Very nice take off and landing.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Fantastic service in business from MUC to SKG. Full service on a 1.5hr flight with many choices. Please change your seats in business class this is a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked. Not comfortable in comparison for what you pay.,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,Automated check in at El. Venizelou Airport was not easy for this first timer and while I could chalk it up to my age other passengers were also having difficulty. At 6:30 am there weren't enough ground staff to help make the process any easier but I finally managed on my own. It has the potential to be a great improvement once the bumps are ironed out. Found seating cramped and the fact that the seats do not recline a real disadvantage. Fortunately it was only a 3 hour flight but I had counted on making up for lost sleep and that proved to be impossible.,no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,Flew from TLV to ATH on July 21st. Long queues for check in staff seemed unprofessional. Cabin crew seems to be very tired no smile at all. I asked for 2 glasses of water after they served breakfast one for me and one for my mother they brought only one and said they would bring the second one. Nothing was brought. Meals were downgraded from hot breakfast to a sandwich that was cold.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew London Heathrow to Athens and back. Great cabin crew very friendly. Food is rather good (for airline food)! Beverage service is excellent. Enjoyed the extra legroom and the leather seats.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Larnaca - Rhodes return. Both flights on time comfy seats and friendly cabin crew. No inflight entertainment probably because it was a short flight but a good experience to fly with Aegean.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,DUS to ATH and 4 days later from ATH to HER. Both flights on time very quick check-in and boarding. Very friendly and attentive efficient staff good service excellent melas even for the short hub from ATH to HER. It will remain our preferred carrier to and from Greece.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew Istanbul-Athens. Plane was new and clean staff warm and friendly and they served drinks and a sandwich on this 1-hour flight. This airline deserves more than a 3-star ranking in my opinion.,yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,LHR to ATH 5th June 2013 at 22.15. Disappointing - having booked online an emergency exit seat this was changed to a normal one at the back of the plane on which another person was sitting. The cabin crew were inadequately trained to handle my complaints appropriately.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,STR-SKG-ATH-TLV. Slightly delayed departure in STR but arrival on time in ATH after short stop in SKG. Great food and good selection of beverages. Departure from ATH was several hours delayed due to striking ground staff. Received vouchers for snacks. Definitively recommended.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Prague to Athens. Nice A320 good crew. However its standards are far below under its competitor - Czech Airlines.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,The flight departed from CDG just a little bit late. But the service was extremely good. Served pasta drinks and hot bread. 3hrs flying time. On time arrival in Athens. Air fare was rather fair.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Flew ATH-DME-ATH. The entire experience from check-in to landing was superb. Clean aircraft with decent seat comfort kind and smiley flight attendants. Both flights on time. They served a hot meal which was good enough and they served cold & hot drinks like 5 times during the flights. Overall a great experience.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Two flights from Milan Malpensa to Athens both on time both on the airbus A320. Staff very kind. Fresh food was good but I'd rather have something hot. The aircraft was very clean. The onboard magazine was good and interesting written in Greek and in English.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH to RHO on an A320-200. Boarding and take-off a bit late but nevertheless it arrived as expected to Rhodes airport. Cabin was clean and shinny and the crew very friendly and looking elegant in their (well designed) uniforms. Seats fairly comfortable and all leather dressed even in economy. One thing I don't like in Aegean aircraft cabins is the seat-plan which makes the cabin feel a bit crowded in fully booked flights. Snack and drink ok nothing special for a short flight but ok. Flight was nice and smooth landing was great. Overall a pleasant and comfortable flight. I think Aegean's reputation as a quality European airline is well deserved.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,FRA-SKG in Economy operated by Aegean Airlines. Bit fussy boarding at FRA and slightest delay due to late incoming aircraft. Shiny new cabin on A320-200 attentive and welcoming staff. Overhead monitors for safety instructions and a flight show. Brilliant hot meal on 2 hour flight accompanied by appetizer (warm roll/butter/mini crackers/spread cheese) and selection of Greek wines in little bottles (not by glass) a dessert and two rounds of very decent coffee. Smooth landing on time. Absolutely recommended.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Aegean started regular non-stop flights between IEV and ATH in Spring 2013. The A320 was 6 years old the cabin was quite ok inside. Seems like the company's making effort to keep their planes clean. Flight attendants were just doing their job without being extra attentive. Catering included Greek cuisine and was good but not substantial - no meat was offered in the meals fine for vegetarians. Inflight entertainment meant magazines and music no TVs or anything else on that particular aircraft. The flight was on time no issues with the baggage. Overall experience is good would definitely fly again for a reasonable price.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,JTR-ATH-DME. Both times there were new A320s with comfortable seats and adequate entertainment - magazines music overhead TV screens. First flight departed with a slight delay - 10 mins but arrived on time. On this 45 mins flight the cabin crew served a cookie and all kinds of napkins (dry and refreshing) but surprisingly didn't offer any drink at all. The next flight was also on time. The catering was tasty with meat little salad and baklava. Drinks of various kinds were offered. Both times the cabin crew was smiley but didn't show much care. Baggage arrived quickly. It was also very convenient to transfer through ATH. I would recommend Aegean Airlines.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Flight ATH-HER-ATH. Slightly delayed (about 15 min delay in boarding/arrival times - both ways). New aircraft very clean with nice seats. Legroom more than good for a 50 min flight Overall I would recommend flying with this airline.,yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"ATH-Santorini-ATH. A320/A321. In Athens check-in OK but boarding was extremely confusing with rude staff (overbooking even for pax with boarding cards. i.e. connecting passengers were refused boarding). In Santorini check-in at 7am completely mad people queuing outside of terminal no ""Gold star Alliance members"" check-in line plus a clear favor for local travel agencies and their pax. Unacceptable.",no
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,A3650 ATH-FCO 28th May 2013. One of the crew had a very bad attitude. She never smiled and just dropped the food in front of me in a very rude way without saying anything. Secondly pre-landing I was using an earphone with the music off. She told me to turn it off which I had done. However I still needed to put the earphones on my ear for descent due to discomfort in my ear during that flight. When she saw me still using the earphones she told me again when I said it was already off and she kept telling me in a rude way to turn it off. She refused to check and kept asking me to put down my earphones.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,FRA-ATH. May 25. A321. Boarding totally messy. Excellent food and drinks. Extremely pleasant staff. Luggage arrived very quickly.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-LCA-LHR economy. Superb inflight service three servings of drinks and appetizing hot meals. Punctuality good. Cabin crew courteous smiling and pro-active.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Cyprus to Athens on Aegean. An excellent flight and a great service. The staff are great and very friendly. Food was also nice. Only downside was check in which had a long queue.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Quick check in boarding and departure on time. We had a light dinner. I have travelled with Aegean many times and I think that on SKG-STR route they should improve catering and entertainment. Staff very friendly.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Paris/CDG-Athens on A321 aircraft. Wonderful service in economy class although flight was delayed for almost 3 hours due to very bad weather conditions (heavy snow). Cabin crew was one of the best I have met on a flight. Meals in Y/C need some improvement.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-NTE 11 August 2012. Flight was on time the meal was served after one hour as we experienced turbulence and flight attendants weren't allowed to serve us. The meal was a sandwich and endless drinks. Crew friendly and smiling. NTE-ATH 18 August 2012: Flight on time. Boarded fast it was 100% complete like the last flight. Flight attendants served the meal immediately so people could sleep (the flight was late in the night). The meal was a sandwich again. Arrived on time. Nice experience will travel again this summer.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Last August from Athens to Prague and back. The airplane was an Airbus A320. Clean and comfortable. The staff were very friendly. Flight took off on time and arrived in Prague on time. The meal was poor but the trip was short. The first part of my trip the aircraft was full from Prague to Athens after 5 days only 60% full. I paid only 125 euros for the ticket!,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Athens-Milan MXP. Airbus A320. Flight on time. Very pleasant trip. Cabin staff as always friendly and helpful. Nice meal.,yes
Aegean Airlines,3/10,Munich to Thessaloniki and back into Frankfurt as part of a connecting flight to/from Heathrow that was actually booked with Lufthansa. Cabin experience was good even though there was no space in the overhead lockers both ways and I ended up storing the bag under the seat which meant reduced legroom. Service on board and catering acceptable but nothing special. Food good but service disorganised and one FA asked the customer to remind another FA to bring him water! Check-in experience was the worst with a huge queue and people trying to barge in. When I raised this with staff at bag drop-off they didn't seem bothered and said they would rather use capacity for the actual desks. Overall customer service on the ground was not great. In future I am going to avoid this airline as would advise you to never try to book a flight on their website. This is meant to confuse and rip you off. I have been booking flights for my own use and for work and have never encountered such an error with the flight dates before. This is a low quality airline charging high fares.,no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,SKG-ATH-FCO return. A320 and A321. All flights about 70% full. Clean cabin friendly and nice crew comfortable seats. Food ok just a sandwich and free drinks. Smooth flights and arrivals ahead of schedule.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,LCA-ATH-MUC. Flight on-time and very pleasant . Cabin crew polite and helpful. Hot breakfast served before we reach Athens and normal meal at the Munich flight. The price a little bit expensive but I would recommend it! As always satisfactory.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,I flew SKG-STR-SKG. I enjoyed the flight. The seat was comfortable and there was plenty of legroom. In addition flight departed on-time. The crew always had a smile however the in-flight entertainment was poor.,yes
Aegean Airlines,                        na                    ,Athens to Paris Nov 5th. Waited for 2 passengers for 35 minutes. Caused us to miss the Paris to Chicago connection by seconds. Aegean flight crew alerted halfway through the flight that we probably wouldn't connect in time and again as we left the plane. No help from them no one was available. Our group of five college educated adults couldn't find any directional signs whatsoever in Paris airport. We could only hear our names being called to board. We reached the gate in time to watch our flight take off. Had to spent the night in Paris. Filthy plane dirty seats badly worn carpet.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-PRAGUE-ATH. A320. Efficient and polite cabin crew smooth service although economy cabin was full. The cold snack (sandwich and tiny chocolate) was rather of poor quality/taste. Cold and hot drinks were offered with a smile. My score would be a 10 if the cold meal was a bit more inspiring!,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Aegean is usually my choice when the price is reasonable very trustworthy. Aircraft are clean and meals tasteful. Almost always on time. Friendly staff friendly excess baggage policy.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,MXP-ATH Jul 15th. A321 aircraft new and comfortable and large legroom. We had a hot meal something that I've seen just on LR flights. Flight on time and efficient crew. ATH-HER Jul 17th. A320 aircraft. Very short domestic flight but more stressful than the previous one. The plane was very crowded and the boarding chaotic. As the flight was just 30 mins long we were served in a rush remarkable that the crew managed to serve 150 people is a short time. In general I'd fly them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Our family of 4 had two flights: Sep 15 from Rome to Athens Sep 18 from Athens to Prague. Both flights were satisfactory. Each one left on time. Candies were offered before take off. Snacks consisted of sandwich and yoghurt; this was for the morning flight to Prague. The evening flight from Rome also offered a sandwich and juice. Good coffee was available. The economy seats were comfortable for my Asian size. But the seat seems to be of standard size whether on an Asian American or European airline. The A320 cabins were clean. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. Check in at Fiumicino and Venizelos airports were fast and straight forward. The only inconvenience we experienced was at Athens airport. It was a late night arrival past 11pm but there was still the hassle of getting off the plane and riding a bus to the terminal. I thought all Aegean jets were not using the tube seeing several of their planes parked in the tarmac at some distance from the terminal. That wasn't the case with the morning flight to Prague as the plane was connected to a tube. Overall value for money is satisfactory. We'd choose Aegean again if an opportunity arises in the future.,yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,Took Aegean for the short hop from Athens to Mykonos. The day we travelled there was a public sector strike which was no fault of the airline. However although they updated their website the day before with a list of delayed and cancelled flights ours did not appear in the list which led me to believe it would run to time. When we checked in they informed me it would run 4 hours late but still allowed us to check in our suitcases. They offered no vouchers or refreshments (which I would have thought for a delay of this length they would have to but maybe strike situations are exempt). We eventually took off 20 minutes later than the new expected departure time. The air crew were so busy talking in loud voices at the front of the cabin we couldn't hear the safety demonstration. It also meant that they did not notice the guy behind us ignoring the instruction to switch off mobile devices as he continued with his. They did however manage to hand out boiled sweets and whizz round with a drinks run which is as much as you could expect on such a short flight. The tickets were expensive considering we booked them 9 months in advance and it was a 25 minute flight.,yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,Travelled LHR-ATH Business Class then ATH-JMK (Mykonos) all Economy. Flight boarding was fine seats the usual European system with centre seat left empty and centre of the seat folded down to form a table. Was offered pre take-off drinks i.e. half a plastic glass of orange juice or one inch of sparkling white wine again in a plastic glass. The drink service was equally mean when ordering a glass of white wine less than half a glass was offered. The meal service was chaotic with only the female cabin manager looking after the 15 B/C passengers. We were booked through to Mykonos with an hours transit time (not enough). We landed and were put on a bus to the terminal then clearing immigration (bags booked through to final destination) we joined the horrendous queue for security through to the domestic flight. The queue took 40 minutes and we made the connection by the skin of our teeth. Not a very relaxing way to start a vacation. On the return flights JMK-ATH was fine only taking 24 minutes. The flight from Athens was full 16 Business Class Passengers and again the service and the quality of the food really let Aegean Airlines down. The cabin crew on both International sectors were out of their depth service was slow and mean in quantity and quality. The return main meal was the worst we've ever had on an aircraft ever.,no
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Athens-Mykonos-Athens. All flights on time very nice looking Airbus 320; good leather seats overhead TV screens and nice cabin crew. They even tried to do some service on those 25 mins flights (sweets and drinks) but on both legs they managed to reach first 6 or 7 rows which is ridiculous in general - nobody expects any service on such a short hop so why bother?,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Have flown Aegean several times to Chania via Athens. Returned on Friday 24th August. We had booked a flight from Chania to Athens due to depart at 11.20. We eventually took off at 12.10 no explanation given. We were really worried as our connecting Aegean flight from Athens to Heathrow was leaving at 13.30! We landed in Athens at 13.15 and still did not know whether we would catch our flight as the stewardess said we could ask once we landed it did not lend itself to a smooth flight experience. However what happened next deserves a gold star: an Aegean representative met us as we came off the plane and escorted us very quickly and smoothly through several checks and security onto our London flight which took off as soon as we were on board at 1335. Amazing! And what is even more amazing is that our luggage was also found and secured onto our flight. Excellent recovery by Aegean.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Return trip to ATH using Aegean for the first time. Would book again. Check in at LHR ok but more efficient in ATH (which is a great airport by the way). Helped that the main carrier in ATH so they have the resource to get people checked in. In flight service good - nice crew on both legs with lots of smiling and team spirit. Food ok but then we all have low expectations. Overall very good experience and would definitely chose over BA on this route.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Belfast-Rhodes-Belfast. Clean Airbus A320. Both flights on time friendly staff but the 'meal' they served consisted of a dry bread roll with one small thin slice of ham which was dry. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meal unless it was water.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,As always excellent service professional attitude for both the ground staff in Brussels as well as the people on board on the BRU-CFU flight on 17 August 2012. I am a frequent flyer with more than 30-35 flights per year. Aegean is the top of my preferences for both my professional trips as well as my vacation. This time I flew with my dog and staff on the ground have been extremely helpful in making my trip troubles free. The service on board is much better from the competition in the Belgium-Greece route. There is a good meal as well as free drinks throughout the flight. The airbus was clean and nicely decorated with enough leg space. In a few words: Aegean was an excellent choice.,yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,We flew LHR-Athens return. Outbound on a fairly new aircraft was acceptable; about average for economy in terms of seat meal and entertainment. Return on a much older smaller plane was ghastly. Seats were tight together like budget airlines and service to match; not a serious national carrier. We were delayed 2 hours on the tarmac at Athens. That was beyond their control but they did nothing to alleviate the discomfort. Children crying cramped seats all taken. It is at times like this one sees the true quality. If all goes well as on the way out it's OK if not and you are on the older planes avoid!,no
Aegean Airlines,4/10,I flew ATH to Corfu on full A320. Aegean are a world class airline as far as domestic flights are concerned but I was very disappointed with service on this flight. Due to Business Class being full 5 rows of economy didn't get served a refreshment at all on the flight. This is very poor cabin management. The crew were taking their time fully aware that they'd never get the service done. Even thought it's just a drink it left a very poor taste in my mouth from a PR perspective especially when they tried to blame bad weather.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,First time on Aegean for a family of 4 to go from Istanbul to Athens. Lines at airport moved fast no hassle on luggage flight left on time and arrived early seats were fairly comfortable and to our surprise we were offered a generous snack even though the flight was barely an hour duration. Overall superior in quality and service than any of the domestic flights we have taken in the US.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Paris-Athens-Mytilini. Compared to the competition this is the only option for Greece. Friendly service good hot food at lunch and evening flight with wine seat comfortable aircraft modern clean and on time. Overall very good.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,SKG to HER. Flight was on time! The plane an A320 Airbus was new and clean inside/out. Cabin crew was pleasant and caring the on board service was good even though the flight was just 1 hour. Seats were comfortable and you have the option to check in online! I have flown many times domestic and abroad and am always satisfied.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-FRA. Another great experience with Aegean on a clean and relatively new aircraft with a meal served by polite and caring crew. Although a moving map was displayed throughout the cabin a movie or some other form of entertainment would have been appreciated for this 3-hour flight (I flew Aegean to London before and a movie was shown). Regardless this airline is a pleasure to fly.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,London Heathrow to Larnaca. Among the most attentive and pleasant crew I have come across. Clean and new airbus food service was very good. Drink service frequent - around 5 times for a 4.5 hr flight. Overall very welcoming and pleasant.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,LCA-LHR on a nice clean A321. Aircraft left Larnaca on time cabin crew looked smart and were polite I had paid only £80 for my one way flight value for money was excellent as all drinks and food was included. Although cabin crew only came round I think 3 times on the 5 hour flight drinks were available on request if needed and cabin crew were happy to serve from the galley. In flight meal was average I find catering on all flights from Larnaca not that great! Seat was comfortable and I had plenty of leg room pilot kept us updated on arrival times and the weather back in the UK which is always nice to know you're going to land bang on time. Despite the bad weather in London landing was probably the smoothest I've ever had on a flight didn't know I had touched the ground! Just wish A3 didn't fly into Terminal 1 at LHR as its not that great and is rather run down other than that Aegean cannot be faulted. A great little airline and I will definitely fly with them again to Greece or Cyprus!,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Flew Aegean to Santorini late June. Short and sweet flight. Cabin crew were professional and aircraft very clean. There was no food and inflight entertainment because of short flight nice gesture providing passengers with a light refreshment.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,ATH - LHR sector on new Airbus A320. Very clean inside and out. Flight departed on time with pre-take off drinks in Business. Comfortable blue leather seats with the middle seat free allowing more room. Attractive and attentive crew service with a smile and very polite. Dinner was a choice from a menu which was plentiful and delicious with a good selection of Greek wines to accompany the meal. Headsets given out and a film shown during the flight. Regular water service throughout with pretzels and snacks. Excellent business product and would definitely use Aegean again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,CDG to ATH. Great experience. Hot dinner was served entertainment was available (which is not the case on the competing companies on that route). Flight on time. Staff was very friendly and professional.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Aegean Air is highly recommended especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They are excellent in the following services: Great Lounges with separate room for smokers. Good luggage priority service in Greece. They must improve the following: Offer free 24h parking just like Olympic Air offer for their Gold members. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights. Dramatically improve their in flight food for local flights.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Went from SKG to STR and after a week the other way around. My flights were A3510 and A3511. Excellent aircraft clean no malfunctioning seats inflight maps 2 captain announcements one the standard and one extra that we would experience some turbulence over Belgrade. Star-Alliance stylished meals served hot enough beverage and coffee happy to help flight attendants ultra-fast baggage drop-off and mobile check- in. I didn't even have to print my boarding pass. Highly recommended!,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,I like to fly with A3 but the last flights (CFU-ATH-MUC) were the opposite. Since we were flying back home to ZRH we wanted to have all boarding cards. But for some reason we only got them until MUC. When I asked the lady at the check in she said Sorry I cannot help. You have to organise yourself in MUC. On both flights the flight attendants wanted to be somewhere else but on the flights. The food this time was inedible and the service awful. For a glass of water I had to ask 3 times and when she finally brought it she just rolled her eyes. I am not sure if I will fly with them again.,no
Aegean Airlines,5/10,Charter service from Tel Aviv to Heraklion. A320 new and clean all leather seats. Only drinks served. All female crew seemed completely disinterested. Airshow available however no position of the aircraft available only the map of the area. Heard good things about A3 service however that was not the experience we had.,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,On 16-JUN my flight from Milan to Athens (connecting to Mykonos) which was suppose to leave at 21.10 left at 02.00. We were given little info other than plane broken and a new one coming from Athens. When the new plane arrived the ground staff and gate were disorganized making the delay even longer. During this extreme delay we were given snacks and water. Once arriving into Athens and missing my flight to JMK a ticket agent helped us and put us on a departure getting us in only a few hours late on Olympic. I emailed Aegean three times to enquire about a refund or another ticket (As we were instructed to do both in MXP and ATH) and it took two emails to get a response. Overall Aegean usually pretty good (I fly once or twice a year) but this interaction made me lose some trust.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Flew from Athens to Santorini in a new A321 aircraft. Economy seats were leather and soft and comfortable and the luggage bins were very large (I was able to fit my acoustic guitar in the cabin). The views as the flight took off and landed were incredible but the flight tickets were slightly expensive for such a short distance. Inflight entertainment was unfortunately absent as the flight (1hr) was too short for it and beverages were only served to half the passengers for the same reason. Otherwise it was a good trip.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,TLV-HER and back. It was a charter flight so I expected a bad experience but was pleasantly surprised. We left on time. The A320 was new and clean. The cabin crew were very helpful and nice. Very informative announcements by the captain. Good leg space.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Paris to Corfu via Athens. All flights were on time aboard newish A320. Food served was ok not great. Absolutely nothing to complain about and the views of the coast were spectacular!,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Athens to London in economy. The flight departed on time and arrived 10 mins early. Very tasty meal served on board much bigger than expected. Several rounds of drinks movies shown during flight. Very attentive cabin staff. Overall an excellent flight for just EUR70.,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,LHR-ATH return. Found Aegean to be very average. Flight out delayed by 2 hours due to high winds with gate attendants 'managing expectations' stringing the delay out by 10 minutes every 15 that went by; however the return was on time. A321's seats are closely bunched for leg room and lack any head rests making sleep tricky on the longish flight. Cabin service was just slow meals of dismal quality in both directions though wine pleasant. A film was shown in both directions which worked OK. Some crew were friendly others were not focused. Online check-in works well but won't from their own iphone app. Experience at both airports fine. I enjoyed the BA experience more on this route for the quality of the product onboard.,no
Aegean Airlines,1/10,I have never experienced such a horrible trip. I was surrounded by 3 children all under the age of 6 who were screaming and yelling through the entire flight. They had toys on the floor and swinging from the chairs in the hallway of the plane and I was stuck in my seat not even being able to use the bathroom. The stewardess did not do much to stop the yelling because it was beyond her. By the time my dinner reached me it was cold and tasteless - last but not least my earphones did not work so I could not hear the TV monitor and had to also pick up trash that was stuck between my seat. Never again.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH. A good experience with Aegean the overnight flight was fairly busy but the crew were professional there were 2 drink runs and the meal was very good but the portions were small. A320 was clean and the leather seats were comfortable. Headsets were handed out there was a good music selection and a movie was shown on the overhead screens. Flight arrived into Athens a few minutes early and the luggage didn't take too long to appear. An extremely good service and would use them again without hesitation.,yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,ATH-LHR with A3. Unfortunately some items in the A3 package continue to deteriorate. I booked my flight 3 days prior to my trip. It was expensive and I thought that the flights would be full nevertheless the flight to LHR was at 65% and the return at 85%. Inflight catering its a joke. Frozen pasta and a very small salad. No water service on 3.5 hour flight. The crew are very efficient but there is no interaction all you see is frozen smiles. Baggage delivery takes a life in LHR and half a life in ATH. Both flights well ahead of time but what's the point if you wait 45 minutes for your luggage? Big problem is that BA has almost the same problems and there is no third alternative on ATH-LHR route.,no
Aegean Airlines,3/10,"Belfast to Larnaca 18th May at 23.40pm. The food was shocking and the staff rude and unhelpful. You were not allowed any drinks after the first round with your meals unless it was water. The toilet doors at the front were locked and out of order. One lady asked about her booked meal - the air hostess replied ""no booked meals tonight"" shrugged her shoulders and walked on. On the way home however Larnaca to Belfast it was like a different airline - air hostesses were well presented and couldn't do enough but the food was still shocking. On both flights - no film or inflight entertainment.",no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH-LHR. Clean new Airbus 320 aircraft. Seats not perfect but good legroom compensates this. A selection of nice music before take off helps you fall in the good travelling mode. Both flights ahead of schedule. I'm scared of flying so a smiling and helpful flight attendants attitude definitely helped. Sweets before take off a small but nice touch. Decent proper meal with honest wine that actually tasted good. Overall a very good airline which helped me begin my holidays few hours before reaching Greece and prolonged it for a few hours when I was leaving.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Heathrow to Larnaca return. Aircraft A321 clean and tidy. Departed and arrived on time both ways. Good food inflight entertainment free drinks great service and friendly crew. Booked well in advance and got a great price. All in all a very good airline.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH-LHR A321. Some things never change. Food inedible I knew this so I went onboard with a full stomach. I understand priority luggage should come first but not 10 minutes before everyone else's! I have noticed this on a couple of Aegean flights. Plane was new and clean as always cabin crew decent. Aegean if you want those extra stars you need better food better luggage handling services and more happy faces!,no
Aegean Airlines,2/10,Heathrow-Athens. A huge line for baggage drop with only 2 Aegean employees to check-in the entire flight. A problem with the baggage belt added more waiting time and frustration. Staff were really snappy and rude. Due to that delay there was a 20 minute delay in boarding and departure. The plane was really hot (the air- conditioning did little to help). Finally when we arrived in Athens we had to wait an extra 20 minutes for bags to start coming out on the belt. Overall an unpleasant travel experience.,no
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Athens to Frankfurt. Nice lounge at Athens with good selection of food. Flight average food terrible breakfast consisted of burnt pasty offering and a bread roll. Overall a fair offering but given the reviews was expecting more.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Thessaloniki-Samos return. Airbus A319 both ways. Flights full. Attentive crew nice flights drinks served for a 50 minutes flight. Recommended.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Staff at Heathrow Airport not very helpful. Manager quite ignorant to people's needs. Cabin crew quite the opposite very polite and always smiling. A shame how one can spoil it for the other. If you have excess luggage I personally think they over charge. They charge £15.00 per kilo and believe me you cannot get away with it.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH return - A320 outbound A321 return. Excellent service and a good fare. Both aircraft's clean and comfortable with several rounds of drinks (wine tea coffee). Food good. Flights on time or ahead of schedule.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH-LHR A320. Flight arrived in London early but luggage delivery so slow in T1 it didn't make any difference. Decent service food horrible as always. New and clean plane. Decent movie onboard.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,I loved flying Aegean Air from Rome to Athens in May 2011. Check in was a breeze. The food was warm and good even had dessert. Staff was courteous and helpful. After flying EasyJet for most parts of my 2 week European backpacking trip flying Aegean was a treat.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Heathrow to Larnaca return in October 2011. Excellent in every respect - new clean aircraft relaxed and attentive service.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR - Mykonos rtn via Athens both ways. 30 minute delay outbound from LHR meant connection was very tight in Athens. Cabin crew provided reassurance to anxious passengers (one crew member saying 'Aegean Airlines cares for its passengers don't worry) and at Athens those of us with tight connections were met by a lady who competently and at very high speed escorted us through what is a complex connecting arrangement. No delays on the return service and we landed 15 minutes early at LHR. Service onboard was good with a hot meal and a free bar. On the way from LHR to ATH we had a new A321 aircraft with in flight entertainment (main screen). Otherwise flights were on a mix of A319 and A320 of varying ages. Thoroughly enjoyed my flights with them the crew work hard and seem proud of their airline.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,LHR-ATH-LHR Business Class. Flight was comfortable with reasonably good service. On return trip breakfast was extremely good - much better than the lunch on the outward leg. No significant delays even though Greek ATC was working to rule.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Athens-Chios-Athens Economy. Despite this being only a 20 minute flight it's operated by an A320. Very few passengers on it on outward leg but quite busy on return with large number of pax transiting Athens en route to US and Canada having been back home for summer. Service was okay - early morning flight so we were offered coffee/ soft drink and chocolate croissant. Check in at Athens was very efficient. Chios is the smallest airport I have experienced but everything went very smoothly - even in a very cramped check in area there was no long delay getting luggage checked in and boarding cards issued.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Staff excellent customer service oriented meals are good and the planes are new. The seats are comfortable and lounge in Athens has a smoking area that is not packed.,yes
Aegean Airlines,6/10,I flew 4 flights with them over the summer and everyone of them was delayed. I am aware there are air traffic control restrictions so may not be the airlines fault. However I feel they are crafty as we were just getting up to a 3 hour delay when they boarded us only to sit on the plane for ages so they would not have to pay any compensation. On the plus side the fleet is modern and new. On all but one of the flights the cabin crew were helpful smart and smiling. I found the food to be adequate although no choice. You can check in online 48 hours before the flight and also book emergency row seats for no extra charge.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,I have often flown Aegean and I always look forward to. Nice service only bad thing - occasionally you book with Aegean and end up having a return flight or a second leg with an inferior company. Make sure you check what connections and return flights are involved.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,LHR-ATH-LHR. Super Flight great crew I was even offered a chance to see the captain. Great movie and lovely food good choice of duty free items lounge was comfortable.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,LHR-ATH-JMK. Bags were transferred seamlessly at Athens which was my main concern. LHR-ATH flight was smooth cabin lighting could have been dimmed with one meal/trolley service for the flight food was served quickly however and the cabin crew were extremely friendly. ATH-JMK was the quickest flight I've ever done and by the time they handed out the drinks they were grabbing them back for landing. Overall a pleasant flying experience helped by the open selection on booking seats (I got exit rows) and the ability to check in 48 hrs before. My one criticism is when doing cabin announcements they speak English so quickly that you do not always hear/understand what is being said.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,LHR-ATH-CFU return. Good planes seats and food. All on time. Let down only by the crew who though very glamorous were a bit clueless. On both long legs I attempted to get a second drink - all met with nods and smiles - to no avail. The Business lounge in Athens was good.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-LCA return in Economy. Cabin crew were attentive and professional. The food was tasteful and drinks distributed 3 times during the flight. Punctual latest aircraft clean.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Professional service. There was a delay of 1 hour from Crete to Athens however we received a voucher for a free domestic flight.,yes
Aegean Airlines,1/10,CAI-ATH-CAI. Flight was on time ground handling efficient. The flight was operated by the small ARJ Aircraft the Crew was inefficient and rude. Meals were below average.,no
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Athens - Heathrow route. Arrived at terminal 1 30mins late due to air traffic. Had another 2.5 hrs to collect baggage and check in at terminal 5 for a domestic flight on BA. A fast walk to the baggage claim took about 20mins and thereafter waited another 30mins for the baggage to arrive. By the time someone accepted us at one of the many empty counters it was already too late. We missed our connection I strongly recommend allowing at least 4 hrs to connect from terminal 1 to 5. The airline itself is very good. Clean and new A321 friendly flight crew and free drinks onboard meal was average.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,I fly around 10 times each year to domestic and European destinations Aegean is my preferred airline for many years now I never had a problem except once where there was a delay of 1hr but they issued a free ticket for me and my wife so I can't complain. Aircraft's always clean stuff friendly and kind. They are a top airline with very good service.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH-SKG ATH-AXD ATH-JMK. Aegean was quite good: flight attendants were nice food was OK the pilot was good when he explained to us that we would be delayed. The only problem was there wasn't enough room for my bag on the plane so somehow it ended up in security and it took 1/2 hr to find it!,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,SKG-STR A320. Everything worked well despite air traffic control strikes in Greece. It was anyway one of the best medium-haul flights. Online-Check-In efficient baggage-drop-off at the counter - no queues. We had to leave Thessalonika before 6pm because of the strikes. Plane arrived late so they really did a good job to turn the plane around in 20 mins. Cabin clean proper looking. Comfortable seating. Great service with a warm meal and a wide choice of beverages. Staff unbelievably friendly and helpful. Arrived on time. Great!,yes
Aegean Airlines,5/10,Paris CDG-Athens. Arrived early at the checkin counter to be told to go away as I was 30 mins early when we did check in there was a queue and things were really slow due to being a terminal. Then because we had excess baggage (which took 20 mins to determine) we had to pay at another counter...20 mins to do that!!!! Then back to checkin counter for another 30 mins delay. All in all after arriving 2.8 hrs before flight departure we got to the departure gate 20 mins before boarding. A complete and utter shambles. Flight though was excellent! Cabin crew were attentive meal good and aircraft/cabin condition clean and modern.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-LHR on A321. Toys were given out to kids before take off. Many passengers had ordered special diets but FA managed to deliver our meals as quick as possible. Always ask if you need a second bread. Hot meal with one choice (beef brisket with rice) and I am amazed how they prepare such a Hong Kong style cuisine! Seats 3x3 not very spacious but good enough for flights less than 4 hours.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,London Heathrow - Larnaca. I found Aegean's price reasonable and A320 was very comfortable. The crew were happy to help and free meals were included which was nice. Great that Heathrow Terminal 4 is used too. Cannot fault.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-LHR economy. Very comfortable seats excellent meal clean and new aircraft and in-flight entertainment. Frequent flyer department are sometimes a bit difficult to deal with and I would have liked more in-flight information from the flight deck. Definitely value for money for a direct flight.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH-LHR A321 new and clean . Sat in row 4A perhaps too far front as the you cant see the TV screen at all due to the fact it is placed on the Business Class Divider (first 3 rows are business class). Flight well priced and I like the fact that their tickets are changable by paying a small fee. The food was fine but portions were too small. Asked for a second meal which was provided after 5 minutes. The luggage collection landing in Heathrow was too slow and took forever. Despite these small issues Aegean Airlines is an airline that I enjoy flying with and the best choice by far out of Athens.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Have travelled with Aegean a number of times already and service is impeccable. Ground crew eager to help and facilitate flights on time comfortable journeys with nice meals on board.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,MXP-ATH in Economy class. Excellent onboard service and some of the best airline meals. The flight attendants were nice and professionally handled a medical emergency right after landing.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Have made several flights with Aegean Airlines in the past year. It was very good value for money. Flights mostly on time inflight service exceptional and friendly FA's. Helpful ground staff. Overall this will be my preferred carrier to Greece.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,CDG TO ATH. Very pleasant flight on time new A320 film with french translation earphone was free. Food hot and excellent. Crew were helpful. Very nice experience.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,This airline was very helpful during a very difficult time. They did not deliberately increase their prices during the mad panic caused by the bad weather in Europe in the days before Christmas. My original booking to travel London to Athens was with KLM and then I was passed to Air France. Neither of them could organize things properly and after endless problems it took them 4 days to get me only as far as Paris with no hope of leaving for at least a day. Aegean came to my rescue and even though they also took off late they made sure I did not miss my next flight with them to a Greek island. During this 4 day nightmare I had to rebook my domestic flight several times with Aegean and they were very accommodating.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,IST-ATH-SKG Business. Very good airline clean planes both on time friendly cabin crew. Got a hot meal on the IST-ATH flight but didn´t have time to finish it due to short length of flight stewardess very apologetic. Will definitely fly them again.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH-HER return. The seats were more comfy and planes were clean and tidy. The staff were nice and friendly. The food was extremely nice although you do not get a choice. All this was complimentary.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,Istanbul to Athens - the best flight with the most courteous flight attendants I have flown in the past 20 years. Keep up the excellent service.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,LHR-ATH return. Crew very friendly and efficient. Food fine - greek oriented cuisine with complementary drinks. Seats comfortable reasonable legroom. As we had young children check in staff put priority labels on our bags for us. My only minor complaints would be at Heathrow they have just 3 or so desks and only open these a couple of hours or so before departure so you have to queue up to check the bags in - web check in is not that straightforward - I was unable to check us all in together but had to do it as 4 separate check ins. Also unable to purchase a ticket online for my son as he was 1yr old at time of booking but 2yrs old when flying and their website could not handle that. Otherwise a very pleasant start and finish to our holiday.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,Athens to Santorini. Aegean have a modern fleet of mostly A320s. The flight was short but efficient. Seats comfortable. Business lounge in Athens is small but has a great variety of food.,yes
Aegean Airlines,10/10,MUC-ATH. The seating was standard European Business with the middle seat blocked. The highlight of the flight was the meal which was a pasta dish with shrimp calamari and tomato sauce - simply excellent. Friendly crew and good service as well as the meal.,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,ATH to FRA. Nice clean A320 polite and smiling crew. Service consisted of nice hot dish (unusual these days for short haul) and dessert Just one round of drinks (wine and beers available free of charge) but those who asked were served a second one with a smile. Crew perhaps a bit too tolerant with passengers who did not respect the seat belt sign during taxiing. .,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,LHR-ATH-LHR. Booked at the last minute because of the BA strike. BMI lounge excellent at T1 Swissport lounge at Athens almost as good. Modern clean A321-200 seats 2A/C outbound & 1D/F inbound. FAs excellent. Food service rather rushed outbound with no pre-lunch drinks and no offer of champagne pre take-off. Food average quality but good to have the Greek accent. Food service and quality similar inbound and still no sign of champagne. IFE unusually provided on a 4 hr flight but consisted of just a single film on overhead drop-down LCD screens. Priority baggage return worked remarkably well both outbound and inbound and the general efficiency of the new Athens airport was a delight. Overall a good product.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Customer support uninterested and never answer emails (despite the fact that I am a Gold card holder). Only contracted lounge in ATH if you are flying extra-Schengen. Unacceptable for the largest carrier in Greece since two of the most popular destinations are extra-Schengen: London and Larnaca. Some of the flight attendants have the nasty habit of ignoring passengers and thereby forgetting to bring drinks or meals to some. Hidden charges - this is not a no- frills airline yet you get charged for booking your flight online (10 EUR) there is no way around this fee as if you buy it over the phone you pay as well if you buy at their ticket desk as well.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,Athens - Tel Aviv return. The price was fair flight was pleasant staff polite cabin clean the food very average as usual!,yes
Aegean Airlines,9/10,BRU-ATH-BRU. Both flights very nice new aircraft on time decent food (hot meal) with entertainment and this on a 2.5 hour flight.,yes
Aegean Airlines,4/10,I have travelled many times with Aegean Airlines from Berlin to Athens Athens to Larnaca but also in domestic flights in Greece. In general I would say that it is a very good company as long as everything goes well and you DONT need anything from the customer support. In that case you have to wait for hours (sometimes days) for someone to pick up the phone quite often to tell you that she/he is not competent to respond to your question and as such your call will be forwarded. Surprisingly 9 out of 10 times nobody will pick up the forwarded call. Another malicious trick they are doing is saying that you should wait for the responsible person to call you. Something that may happen after a week or so if you get lucky. They also have the bad habit of not informing the passengers for delays or other unexpected event that may jeopardise the trip. I missed a flight once (one of the very few that departed that day) because the advice of the Athens airport information desk (Aegean did not pick up the phone or the line was busy from 9 in the morning till midnight) to to my question if the flight will be delayed-cancelled or not was to go at the airport four o'clock in the morning and hope that the flight will take place otherwise ask the Aegean people there. I didn't risk it. As a result I was waiting 4 months to get the taxes from the ticket back. There are also hidden charges as using the internet to book tickets involves a fee the same applies though if you book the tickets by phone.,yes
Aegean Airlines,2/10,I recently flew from Athens to Milan. One extra bag cost 325 Euro. I could have purchased two tickets providing for two adults with bags for each less expensive. The counter agents were disinterested and responded to each other in Greek which I do not understand. This practice is unreasonable and unacceptable.,no
Aegean Airlines,8/10,ATH-IST on a new A320 (there is a possibility of e-check-in or mobile phone check-in). personally I am not using those services. I prefer the traditional check-in line which was convenient and not crowded. The service was nice the crew was friendly but when I asked for a newspaper the flight attendant took a note of my seat; but she never brought me the newspaper (may be they run out of newspapers because they had lot of people in business class). In the returned flight the flight attendant noticed my seat and then she brought the newspaper to me. There was no IFF but on overhead screen you could see the map of the flight and flight information. Food was nice with selection of wine or beer. Both flights on time and about 60% full. On the return flight they had time for duty free trolley.,yes
Aegean Airlines,8/10,Self Check-in is easy for use but unfortunately not cover most abroad airport (e.g. CDG France). Manual Check-in is a little slow. Meal is very good even for economy class. The staff attitude and friendliness is impressive. And the flight is very comfortable.,yes
Aegean Airlines,7/10,ATH-LHR on A321 was great with nice inflight entertainment. Food average and crew professional.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,"  Efficient and polite check-in at Athens Airport, buses used to access aircraft for boarding. Greeted at aircraft door by smiling and courteous cabin crew who tried to keep order when passengers were finding their seats but the problem was that people were not listening to crew instructions and were not maintaining social distance. Many were British tourists I'm sorry to say. Very short flight, just 20 minutes and we landed early. Polite goodbye from crew. Nice flight.",yes
Olypmic Air,1/10," Most unpleasant flight ever. Their method of boarding the plane wasn’t very Covid-19 friendly so if you are someone who is concerned I wouldn’t recommend you travel on this airline. Most airlines board back to front to keep crossing paths with others to a minimum. Where as this airline boarding all window seats, then all middle, the all aisle seats together in bit seat order meaning that there were about 40+ people all trying to get ton in each bath and crossing paths. They also wouldn’t let you use the overhead lockers above you which causes you having to walk up and down the aisles to find space and then squeezing past people to get back to your seat. The worst thing about the journey was the staff were quite unfriendly and rude. If you want to ruin a relaxing holiday and come back stressed - 10/10 would recommend,",no
Olypmic Air,2/10,"  I flew with Olympic air from Crete to Athens. They have an inconvenient website which is not very clear of what baggage is allowed. When you go for bag drop the crew, with attitude find all the reasons to charge you more. I will avoid to fly with them from now on.",no
Olypmic Air,2/10,  I and two of my friends had a flight from Santorini to Athens. I had a long term schengen Visa which allowed me to roam the European union before I came to Santorini where my Visa was checked multiple times. Turned out the ground staff was unaware of such visa. Thanks to one person among those who let me in. Then one of the air hostess skipped me for the chocolates and cookies.  Though I don't have any complaints from other air hostess who were friendly and fine. ,no
Olypmic Air,8/10,"  The self check in was extremely busy especially because of the congestion at the Athens Airport. However, Aegean/Olympic agents were helpful and move me fast. Flight was on time and the ATR was clean, comfortable; food service and beverages was very generous. I found out that the Athens-Malta leg is run under the Olympic brand and they feed you well. Indeed, they announced Olympic when they went on air, but I was holding a Aegean Ticket. This is when I found out that its a double brand. We arrive on time in Malta. It was an ATR aircraft so I was not expecting any sort of in-flight entertainment and WiFi. Its was a short leg. I would love to fly Aegean/Olympic again. Great service and great people, distinctively Greek.",no
Olypmic Air,2/10,"  Heraklion to Athens. My husband and I were very disappointed with the unexpected charge of 70 euros (35 each) for our luggage. We were on our way back to Athens from Heraklion after almost 2 weeks of travelling to different islands with our 2 luggage (where are you supposed to leave them?). Finally, we were returning to Athens to catch our flight home and the attendant at the desk told us we had to pay for the luggage. After trying to explain to her, unsuccessfully, the situation, she kept going in circles. Where’s the courtesy to tourists who are coming to the country to spend their money, sounds like abuse to me. Well, I know I sound bitter, and I am. I don’t think is fair.",no
Olypmic Air,1/10,  Chania to Athens. Be aware of this airline delays. I lost 1 day of my 4 days vacation due to their last minute delays. It's sad that during summer morning flights should be delayed. ,no
Olypmic Air,2/10,"  Santorini to Istanbul via Athens. Santorini flight to Athens delayed 2 hrs. The other flight in transit from Athens to Istanbul same airline (Olympic / aegean) wouldn’t wait although only around 30 mins behind schedule.  In result, they gave us another flight 9 hrs later from Athens to Istanbul. And as a result, we couldn’t able to catch our third flight from Istanbul to ASR. We had to deal with the flight to ASR ourselves with Turkish airline. They cannot able to help although they are partners. We had to get the flight on the next day to ASR from Istanbul. All the things planned and hotel are ruined.",no
Olypmic Air,2/10,  Athens to Sitia. Passengers are forced by ground staff at ATH to use the self-tagging system of luggage without any efficient help or guidance. Response of indifferent handling agents: “It is the company’s policy”. Worst check-in experience ever. Cabin crew should better get rid of haughty attitude towards passengers and shape up with some professionalism…,no
Olypmic Air,10/10,"  Athens to Chios. The staff was very nice and polite. How short the flight may be, 45 min. including take off and landing, they were still serving snacks and refreshments. I am a tall person, 1,85, so the seats were a bit small, but that was no problem at all. Because it is a small airplane. When our baggage was delayed last year, it was handled very well, they flew it in the same day on the next flight. Over all it isn't for nothing that it is the best domestic airline!",yes
Olypmic Air,5/10," Rhodes to Athens with Olympic Air. The flight itself was fine. The A320 was clean, with those typical hard-cushioned thinner type seats albeit with good legroom. You also get a free sugar kick via a paper cup of coke, a cookie and a candy in a swift non-dentist-friendly service which is not much, yet already 3x more than what you get on an LCC. Engaged FAs with a certain flair also add to the appeal. The problem was that the flight was delayed for over an hour yet no one considered it a good idea to inform people already queing up at the gate. It was only 5 mins after the original departure time (still on the gate screen) that a ground handling lady showed up to inform passengers that the plane hadn't taken off yet from Athens, so she couldn't really say when we would fly. Why on earth would A3 just let people go airside at what is easily one of the busiest airports per square ft, just to try to find a spot to seat for hours with no info? And even if the airport staff at Rhodes is overwhelmed, why don't you use the app to inform passengers? As I type this, I see that the Sunday flight was also an hour and 15 mins late. Is that a pattern? Bottom line, if you are booking your flights independently, allow plenty of slack for your connecting flights as high season ramps up.",yes
Olypmic Air,4/10,  Olympic Air flight from Athens to Rhodes was operated by Aegean. The flight departed on time and reached destination on time. No food or beverages served on 1 hour flight. Seat space was so limited. Very disappointing. ,no
Olypmic Air,9/10," Direct flight a new service from Athens to Catania and return. It was full of Italian tourists returning home. I asked them why they do not travel with Alitalia. They replied that they got better service, lower price and they do not have to go via fiumicino.",yes
Olypmic Air,2/10,"  Kefalonia to Athens. I fly Olympic regularly between Athens and Kefalonia and there are always problems. This trip, the online check in failed. At the airport I had to pay 5 euro for extra leg room and it took them an hour to process the payment. Then I was told the plane was so full my hand baggage had to go in the hold. The plane was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead storage. Needless to say, the flight was late and on arrival in Athens the baggage took a long time to arrive. Avoid if possible.",no
Olypmic Air,1/10,"  Myself and my girlfriend had a flight from Milos to Athens today 27/08/2018 arriving at 2pm to catch another 2 connection flights to Slovenia from Athens. For some reason the aircraft was small for the number of passengers booked in that flight, so they decided to leave us out together with some other passengers, giving 250 euros to compensate this mistake. The problem is we had to buy new flights for tomorrow morning which cost 700 dollars plus the accomodation and transport in Athens, plus I've been trying to contact their customer service for over 3 hours and no one picks the phone. It was definitely the worst airline I have dealt with.",no
Olypmic Air,2/10,"  I had my flight booked in the evening at 23:00 from Chania to Athens. Due to unforseen circumstances my partner had to leave earlier in the morning to a different destination. I was at Chania airport from 11am for that reason and I asked at the Olympic Air desk about availability of earlier flights instead of waiting alone till 11pm at the airport. I found the staff very unhelpful reporting that there are seats left at the 18:00 flight but I have to pay 60 euros extra fee for the change of flight. I was expecting a little bit more understanding, especially since they saw me standing there all day in front of them until 5pm. I value kindness and morality above money, but clearly this is not the case for this company. I would not recommend this airline for that reason.",no
Olypmic Air,10/10,"  Athens to Catania. Direct excellent flight, everything was on schedule, departure, flight time and arrival at Catania Airport. Service was excellent though not enough space in the aircraft. This is why the airplane was fully booked from Italian tourists. I would fly again. I saved valuable time instead of flying via Rome.",yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,"  Athens to Tirana. After 4 hour waiting in Athens the smooth boarding process started. Bus transfer to the propeller aircraft. The flight was full and just took 1 hour 20 minutes. Usually on such short intra european flights there is no inclusive meal service. To my surprise, direct after take-off a sandwich was served with free beverages, beer or wine. Thereafter coffee or tea with a small cookie. Like european flights 20 years ago. Cabin crew were friendly and we landed on time in Tirana.",yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,"  Flew Milos to Athens. I always like to fly Olympic Air (and Aegean) because I love the product these airlines offer, and this flight fulfilled my expectations. First of all the flight time is not even 25 minutes. The cabin was very clean and fresh, we had a great flight attendant who was a shining example for the industry: professional, friendly and caring. She handled (alone!) the fourty-seater, fully booked plane effortlessly. It is amazing that on such a short hop you get a choice of beverages and a snack. Great Job Olympic, it was a pity that the flight was so short.",yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,  Kavala to Athens. Flight departed on time. Smooth boarding. Crew were extremely professional and polite. Snacks and beverages were served. Smooth arrival at Athens International Airport. Baggage delivery was fast. Highly recommended.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10," Very good organization and attitude from Olympic Air flight staff. Continous non stop service from Athens to Thessaloniki and wide variety of drinks, foods and beverages. Short flight however all passengers were smiling with the friendly services rendered. Reached destination earlier than the scheduled time. I would travel again.",yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,"  Athens to Belgrade. Flight booked with Aegean Airlines but operated by Olympic Air. Relatively small aircraft for a short route (Athens to Belgrade) and a bit slower than jets, however it was pretty pleasant and the bonus is that there is no middle seats and also the views were great. Some Israeli passenger were pretty worried and a bit aggitated, as some friends were coming from another (connection) flight and they had not showed up, however the crew informed them that that the aircraft would be waiting for them and they would not miss the flight. They were pretty professional and the 3 connecting passengers showed up. The aircraft departed with a minimal delay of 10 minutes and landed almost on time. Althouh they charge for checked luggage and the aircraft is small, the situation was pretty ok. Relatively good size baguette was served, which tasted well, a sweet snack and 2 rounds of drinks. Crew very professional. Buses were used on both airports - this aircraft is not compatible with bridges. to sum up it was a nice and comfortable flight. Totally recommended!",yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,"  Heraklion to Athens. After a rather fast bus boarding procedure and a kindly welcome by the cabin crew, the plane took off in time. The breakfast was excellent for a 40 minutes flight: warm criossants, a delicius cappucino with a perfect milk froth, greek yoghurt, local vegetables and a variety of cheeses which came along with chocolates, and several other snacks; not to mention the large options of beverages. The flight experience can be summed up as marvellous!",yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,"Connection from Athens to Zante with Olympic Air. Although the flight was marginally delayed we still managed to arrive on time on the island. These internal short hop flights are always full but service is exemplary, plane clean and a pleasure to utilise for Greek island ""hopping!"" Same again in 2017 for my annual visit.",yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,  I flew Olympic Air from Athens to Chios. The cabin crew was very helpful and I was amazed that snacks and drinks were served in such a sort flight (about 25 mins). The pilots were very informative and performed perfect landing despite strong winds. The aircraft was very clean. I would fly with Olympic Air again.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,"Olympic Air takes most of the flights within the Greece. Even though the flight was very short, around 30 minutes, crew service was excellent. The weather was bad, severe turbulence and the steward was outstanding. He manages to calm us down even though the flight was not very pleasant due to the bad weather. The plane was the one with propellers which was a little loud, but it is fun. Due to the bad weather they did not any snacks or drinks, but we did not care, we just wanted to land in one piece. The view from the plane was marvellous while we were landing, the nature in Greece is wonderful. And overall, we were very satisfied with the service of Olympic Air.",yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,"We have flown with Olympic Air twice, once was from Athens to Kefaloania, and the 2nd time was from Zakynthos back to Athens. Both were pleasant. The crew, food, drinks, service and view out the window was great. Would fly Olympic Air again.",yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,"Flight attendants were very polite and helpful. It's aircraft are not very well preserved (the interior of the aircraft). The seats were comfortable but you could see they where a bit worn at their edges, also the windows are very blurry and scratched. ",yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,"Took a quick 45-min flight from Athens to one of the Greek Isles (Milos) and was pleasantly surprised. A very good price, both to/from flights departed on time, cabin crews were extremely friendly and did a quick beverage service. The flight is by propeller plane (plane itself was dated) and has maybe 20 seats total, and does bus to runway boarding. Overall a very good experience and was the same price, though like 4 hours faster than taking a ferry from Athens so I'd definitely recommend the trip.",yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Traveling from Samos to Lesvos with a transfer at Athens Airport. We went through the airport of Samos pretty fast we had too many bags with us so we needed to pay an extra fee which was 30 euros for each suitcase (didn't care about the weight) which I find a very fair price. Flight attendants were very kind and even for this short flight (25min) to Athens they came around with a drink and a snack. The stopover in Athens was not very useful for us because we transferred to another gate to end up on the same plane we had came from with exactly the same cabin crew. Overall a good experience would recommend it to others.,yes
Olypmic Air,4/10,ATH-SOF on Q400 (noisy plane). During the 1 hour 5 min flight they offered sandwich refreshments or wine and coffee / tea with a croissant. Food was very bad and tasteless. Staff was professionals and friendly. Flight was on time. Appearance of plane was clean.,yes
Olypmic Air,5/10,The check-in process for this super quick 30 min flight from Santorini to Athens on a Dash 8 plane was shockingly disorganized! Once we got on board though they actually managed to serve drinks and peanuts which impressed me for such a short flight.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,JMK-ATH A3 377 7 Aug 2014. Flew Mykonos - Athens on a clean Dash 8. Welcomed on board by very polite and smiling cabin crew. Despite the fact the flight time was only 20 minutes a full drink service was offered with napkins ice and peanuts. The 2 Flight Attendants never looked stressed or hassled and full marks to the Purser for her excellent PA announcements made in Greek and very good English. Upon landing again the goodbye and thank you greeting was given with sincere smiles and professionalism. Shall definitely fly Olympic again.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Flew on the 16th of June Athens to Mykonos. Very short 35 min flight on a dash 8 Q400. Staff were courteous and happy to help (on ground and inflight). Regardless of the short flight drinks and some peanuts were served which was a nice touch considering how short the cruise time was (roughly 5 minutes) before descent started.,yes
Olypmic Air,2/10,Our flight was scheduled for 1450hrs but we were delayed at security screening due to the long queue and we came from a connecting flight. When we rushed to the boarding gate at 1440hrs we were unable to board. The gate controller wanted to help us but somebody on the other end of her walkie-talkie refused to let us board. The bus driver was waiting to rush us to the plane but in the end everything was in vain. We had to get another pair of tickets for a next day flight and spend the night at the airport as a result. The plane did not even attempt to wait for us but preferred to take the time to offload out luggage. In all experiences flying although not required all airlines planes have always given an unspoken grace period of perhaps 5-10 mins for late passengers some even longer as connecting passengers have to rush through gates. We would not have gone past 5 mins boarding time and Olympic Air refused to wait. We forfeited a booked hotel night stay and had a bad experience with getting another ticket.,no
Olypmic Air,9/10,Very quick 40 minute flight from Athens to Mykonos and back. Great helpful staff and they tried to serve a drink each way and a snack but ran out of time. New aircraft and comfortable economy seating.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Flight from Milos to Athens. Aircraft dash 8-100 old but with a clean cabin. Very good service for a 35 mins flight.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,Flight from Athens to Vienna in business class. Very nice service from the crew and a fantastic breakfast. Aircraft was a new airbus A319.,yes
Olypmic Air,1/10,Flew OA on 21st July Athens - Corfu route. Flight operated by bombardier Q800 aircraft. Before take off cabin was too hot. Airplane is not convenient if you have special needs. Aisle was very thin and the toilet was so small it was hard to move with the door closed. I will avoid this airline.,no
Olypmic Air,8/10,From Athens to Santorini. The flying time was so short around 35 mins. But served cookies and hot drinks. The flight departed from Athens on time. Flight announcement was clear and correct.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,SMI-ATH-SMI route (once or twice a month). OA uses small Bombardier airplanes whose seats do not recline. There is enough leg space (I am 185cm) and the seat width is fine. There is no inflight entertainment. The personnel has always been very polite and helpful. The only problem with OA are the outrageously high prices for its domestic flights especially for destinations like SMI where there is no competition.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,I fly with Olympic Athens-Istanbul-Athens twice a month for the last 3 years and I'm very satisfied. They provide nice meals (even on short flights). What I dislike is that they partially switched to the Dash 8 Q 400 turboprops from the A320 for some destinations (Istanbul included sometimes). I'd recommend them.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,Athens-Limnos on a Q400. Check in quick and efficient. Boarding by bus but quite efficient too. The flight left five minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early. It was smooth and the friendly crew worked very hard to get everyone a drink and nuts on this 40-min flight. There was ample leg room. A good experience.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,ATH-BEG-ATH with Q400 both flights were 5-7 minutes late. When I was web-check in I forgot the type of the aircraft and I checked a seat on the sun side. That is a problem because the aircraft has no shades. The service was excellent with very friendly staff but with an unfriendly / noisy aircraft.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Took a flight from Belgrade to Athens which was fairly empty. Friendly ish crew who brought a seemingly never ending supply of drinks plus a snack comprising a nice-enough sandwich and a delicious chocolate croissant. All on time.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,ATH-LRS-SMI-ATH. Olympic has improved very much over the years: good check-in with friendly agents. Onboard smart cabin crews who provide a good and smiling service. The transfer of our luggage to Paris was perfect I would fly them again.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,I have to admit to being somewhat concerned about booking Olympic Air but Aegean was very expensive in comparison. So I booked 2 tickets to/from Athens to Heraklion. The web-site was easy to navigate and the process simple. We did have one slight schedule change on our outbound flight which didn't affect our plans. We checked-in on-line the day before each flight and printed our boarding cards bag drop was easy to find and our bags were taken quickly. Boarding in Athens a bit late but we made up the time en route. Aircraft in both directions a Q-400 which was bright and clean. We didn't expect anything on-board but were surprised to be served a beverage and a packet of nuts/cookie. Cabin crew were well presented and couldn't do enough. All in all a great experience.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,I have just returned from Zante and I found that both flights were what I'd expect from any other company. Seats were comfortable however there was not much leg room. Flights were on time both inbound and outbound although there was a flight to Manchester with Olympic at the same time as ours to Gatwick which was delayed overnight.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,Flew Mykonos to Athens with Olympic Air in Premium Economy. Check in was polite and efficient. Aircraft was clean inside and out had seat 3A. Pre take off drink was served. Left on time and a filling and tasty snack of pasta salad and a cake was served with a drink by 2 polite and professional cabin crew. A very comfortable flight and we landed on time. Would recommend Olympic Air and would choose them again.,yes
Olypmic Air,2/10,I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Olympic Air is below expectations especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They must: Renovate their Lounges in Athens Airport as soon as possible. Dramatically improve their Luggage priority service. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights.,no
Olypmic Air,1/10,"After an extreme delay in Milan on Aegean and missing my flight to Mykonos I was rebooked on Olympic Air. I took my new ticket and other Aegean info the Olympic counter to check in as I was told. I had been up all night with no sleep and after handing the agent the new tickets and my passport and my old Aegean ticket he literally threw it back at me and said ""you are flying Aegean not Olympic"" and rolled his eyes. After a deep breath I informed him I had been rebooked and he then asked why I didn't show him the new ticket in a nasty tone. I informed him I handed him the new ticket with my passport and if he took time he would have noticed. I asked him politely why he literally threw the papers at me even if I was flying with Aegean and if that was how he was trained to deal with the public. I also asked him if I needed a manager to check me in. Then after no apology he then checked me in and I was on my way. I go to Greece often and this experience is why I usually try to fly Aegean. The flight itself was a joke. They set up the beverage cart to serve two people (me and one other in front) and then took cart to back to breakdown. But everyone was nice except the ticket agent.",no
Olypmic Air,8/10,Flew several legs Athens to Heraklion to Rhodes domestic as well as Athens Tirana international. Even on the short haul flights they had some sort of food and beverage service other than the chaotic embarkation process the flight and attendant experiences were very pleasant.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Travelled from Athens-Rome then to Paris and London over a 3 week period. The cabin was clean and staff were attentive polite and well presented. I will travel with them again in the future true value for money.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Athens to Kos and back. Both flights on time aircraft new and clean. Ground staff and cabin crew nice and helpful. Happy with the whole experience.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,ATH-LCA-ATH on clean and comfortable A320 with plenty of leg room in economy. Efficient crew provided excellent service on both segments of the trip. Sufficient cold meal for this short flight free drinks including wine and beer. Luggage was delivered quickly.,yes
Olypmic Air,                        na                    ,2 hour delay going out from Birmingham only to be told when we were up in the air that we would be landing in Greece to refuel and no one could provide us with an explanation. The plane was dirty with rubbish on the floor and in the back of seats chewing gum stuck to the side of the chair. They missed our meals out and we had to point it out staff throughout the flight were chewing which was unprofessional. On the return we were delayed for 15 hrs with no explanation what so ever we were given a 3.50 euro voucher. Instead of returning on 24th we returned on the 25th. We will not be travelling with them again.,no
Olypmic Air,9/10,Despite the delay departure of 30 mins from Athens to Tirana due to system's break down the flight went smoothly. I was excited onboard DHC-8-400 for the first time. The plane was clean and seems new. The onboard crew were friendly and helpful. The refreshment service for this 1 hr 15 mins flight was rendered efficiently.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,Athens to Chania Crete return. A pleasant surprise given previous problems with Olympic airlines. New aircraft A320 both ways clean pleasant friendly staff excellent door-to-door service for my elderly parents on the way to Chania no delays.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,Athens-Kythira Island (ATH-KIT) on a Bombardier Dash-8-Q400 NextGen. This is a Public Obligation Service route in Greece and the price is reasonable (120 euros return ticket). The flight takes only 30-35 minutes. The cabin interior was clean and modern and the cabin crew very good offering a small snack and bar service to a full load of 78 passengers in such a short flight.,yes
Olypmic Air,7/10,I found a good deal from Athens to Vienna return. I went on Airbus A319 (SX-OAF). The plane was clean the seat pitch good but not as good as the seat pitch of Boeing 737-300/400. The staff were friendly and the menu good. I returned on another A319. Was very full because Austrian Airlines cancelled their flight to Athens. The only problem is that they don't fly to destinations in Europe.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,ATH-AMS. Check in a breeze friendly ground staff and at the gate. Punctual departure candy given for departure and hot lunch and 2 rounds of drinks offered on this 3h10min flight. Young and friendly staff also showed interest in passengers and cared for flight safety. Flight was only half full but this airline is definitely a good deal nowadays both in price and service. On time arrival and bags showed up soon. They are better value then most competitors. No IFE though in this new A320.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,ATH-RHO excellent and new A320 aircraft smiley crew and very helpful leather seats excellent service and enough legroom. The flight was on time. Excellent take off and Landing.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,ATH-CHQ return. Nice new aircraft in both directions ATR-72 and A320 with leather seats and good seat pitch. Check-in fast in Athens onboard service was great and surprised to get a meal on short flight. The only annoying thing - we checked in an hour and 45 minutes ahead in Chania (a bit early I know) and the staff were present but made all of us wait another 20 minutes until they opened the counter. Other than that we had a good experience with Olympic.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,EFL-ATH-LHR return. Can't fault a thing really good snacks and coffee served on the short hop to Athens a good hot lunch / dinner served by very attentive crew on LHR sectors seating comfortable with more than adequate leg room although some form of entertainment would have been appreciated. Service only slightly marred by being told by a crew member that they would only serve me two white wines as if I was some school child! All flights on time baggage delivery at LHR painfully slow though which needs some attention but not really the airlines fault.,yes
Olypmic Air,                        na                    ,AMS-MUC by Lufthansa - my flight AMS-KTM was cancelled due to weather. I was rerouted via Athens by Olympic. My two bags were not accepted by Olympic Air unless I paid 160 euro for the flight to Athens. The fact that Lufthansa had accepted the luggage made no difference. I refused to pay and had to call family to collect one of the bags. At the gate I was told that there was no meal for me. I got the lame excuse that my booking was made at the last minute. Had they told my while checking in I could at least have bought some sandwiches at Schiphol. After arrival in Athens and while checking in it became clear the my luggage was only labelled to Athens despite my request to label it all the way to KTM. My booking was all the way to KTM on one PNR. Filing a complaint with Olympic Air customer service produced a deafening silence. Beware of these amateurs!,no
Olypmic Air,8/10,JTR-ATH on DHC-8. Plane loaded due to ferry cancellations. Very small overhead bins. Enough legroom for a short flight. Service was drink with cookies/sandwich - surprised on such a short flight. FAs quite friendly.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Athens-Sofia-Athens. Athens-Sofia an A319 clean and smart cabin. A quite substantial snack was served by all-female cabin crew who were pleasant and efficient. The food was reasonably good. Sofia-Athens leg a Dash 8-Q400 again with an all-female cabin crew friendly and efficient service.,yes
Olypmic Air,2/10,LHR-ATH route in Business Class (waste of money) with a nearly full dirty aircraft. Crew members huddling in the galley engaged in conversation that apparently could not be interrupted by offering any semblance of proper passenger service. Heard a lot of hype about the NEW Olympic but in reality was greatly unimpressed. After repeatedly using the call button and being ignored I went to the galley only to find a flight attendant eating from a meal tray and busily stuffing small liquor bottles into her purse. Lavatories not serviced and reeked. Avoid Olympic at all costs.,no
Olypmic Air,8/10,Athens to Santorini on A320. Check in quite good. Used Goldair Lounge at Athens as I got in free with Diners Card. Aircraft interior different to normal OA A320 with dull grey seats. However legroom excellent and service was very good. Much more refined than the old Olympic. Served drink and cookies for the 45min flight. Return on Dash8 aircraft leased from Flybe. OA staff and livery. Small cramped cabin but excellent service with unlimited soft drink and a sandwich/cookie.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,Economy Class Athens-Corfu-Athens. Service onboard excellent. Both flights in the early morning and cabin crew was very welcoming. The usual choice of beverages was offered along some biscuits filled with vanilla.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Rhodes-Athens business class. Staff friendly and attentive with a good standard of English. Food a small salad type meal. On arrival at ATH business pax were provided with a separate bus to the terminal arrival was quick and efficient.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,IST-ATH and ATH-AMS. Seamless and quick check-in boarding and baggage. Modern clean aircraft (B737 and A320). Meals were great and surprisingly substantial for short flights. Good experience and would fly Olympic again.,yes
Olypmic Air,5/10,My daughter (10yrs) flew Paris to Zakynthos through Athens on 18th July with the unaccompanied services. She did tell me about the UM service in Athens - when she got there she was taken to a room with other children to wait 3 hours for the next flight. The staff in the room who was supposed to look after them smoked all the time. This is absolutely shocking to see the way they treat children.,yes
Olypmic Air,10/10,Economy Class LHR-ATH-EFL A320 & Dash 8-400. A huge improvement over the old Olympic Airlines. LHR-ATH on a new aircraft more than adequate legroom a decent hot meal served with complimentary beverages. Motivated hard working and smiling crew. ATH-EFL was equally good with a snack and beverages on 45 minute flight.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,LCA-ATH-LCA flights were on time and enjoy the new look cabin. Food was acceptable with a sandwich and cereal for Breakfast and a Greek salad + roll for dinner on the return. Only annoyance is they changed the return from an A320 to an A319 so my pre-booked exit row seat ended up being just a normal seat and the seat ended up being broken did take me three attempts to get someone to move me.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,London Gatwick - Athens economy class. A320 everything from staff uniforms to the interior was new. The plane was equipped with PTV screens but no inflight movie or any form of entertainment offered during this 3+ hrs flight. Lollies and newspapers handed out prior to take off inflight hot meal served with wine. Plane arrived early in Athens bags came out a bit late. Overall pleasant trip.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,Athens-Vienna return on A319. Cabin interior lavatories clean. Seat pitch quite comfortable. Candies and newspapers offered after boarding. Hot meal served and plenty of cold and hot beverages. Cabin crew polite and professional. In-flight magazine was average there was no video/music entertainment available.,yes
Olypmic Air,9/10,Heraklion to Athens Athens to Rome. Flights both excellent planes clean (A319 and A320) and flight attendants very professional. ATH-FCO a cold meal was served - in both segments they gave us cookies in the shape of Christmas trees. Complimentary beverages including wine served on ATH-FCO segment and complimentary non-alcoholic beverages on HER-ATH segment. My husband and I were both impressed with the quality on Olympic Air.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,AMS-ATH return. New Airbus aircraft friendly and polite cabin crew with elegant uniforms. Legroom was great service outstanding sweets before take-off meal service including drink rounds. They are trying hard to provide an excellent service and to my opinion they did.,yes
Olypmic Air,8/10,CDG-ATH A320. Welcomed by a friendly crew seats quite comfortable. I was sitting one row behind the emergency exit and the cabin crew came to brief the passengers about the operation of the doors in case of emergency. Started =service with drinks and then a hot meal. After that more drinks as well as coffee or tea along with a box of chocolate cookies. Overall good service smiling crew and good value for money bearing in mind I booked the ticket a few days ago and the plane was nearly full. Still room for improvement though as there is still no in flight entertainment or a good magazine to keep the passengers busy.,yes
Olypmic Air,7/10,Delays are pathogenic to Olympic Air. ATH-TIA left with 25 minutes delay. The plane was a Q400 new but uncomfortable and noisy - had a window seat which was not reclining and there was no window shutter. Newspapers were not offered lunch was not offered on a tray but a plastic box with sandwich and a confection. After drinks / coffee they gave us box with cookies. Return with A319 change of equipment was probably because there was still a problem of delays. The aircraft did not have a business class area. We were offered newspapers (in the old way manner left on the galley to be picked up) but this time food offered on a tray - tasteless and indifferent. I could not complain but the service was not remarkable. The hostesses were all girls (there is clearly a problem with men stewards) friendly and more than helpful.,yes
Olypmic Air,7/10,"LHR-ATH new A320. Aircraft was clean but grey and gloomy. Food surprisingly good good coffee by airline standards. Service excellent. The return flight was another new A320 whose blue seats gave economy class a feeling of being a cut above budget-airline equivalents. Food and service of a high standard although trays could have been cleared away sooner - and the aircraft was rather warm. Check-in for both flights was a breeze. Olympic Air has made a promising start with a new impression of efficiency that will be a revelation to anyone familiar with its predecessor. But London to Athens is a most competitive routes and at the moment Aegean still edges it offering in-flight entertainment where OA had none (a surprising omission) and its own magazine (aside from a one-off souvenir magazine commemorating OA's heritage OA's magazine is in fact that of the parent company MIG beefed up with OA-specific content and is in Greek only). Furthermore the frequent plugging of MIG's other brands was seriously off-putting even it did mean free biscuits promoting its food arm. Hearing ""Thank you flying Olympic Air part of Marfin Investment Group"" at the end of the flight is a surefire way to drain the glamour out of the Olympic brand name and any remaining romance out of flying altogether. Nobody loves a conglomerate so a bit more subtlety would go a long way. I'll keep my eye on OA in the future but for the time being will probably continue to choose Aegean for this route.",yes
Elinair,10/10,"  Mykonos to Thessaloniki . A short, super enjoyable flight!  Everything went well on both flights, the planes were nice and clean, crew presentable, professional and helpful, and the flights on time, short and so enjoyable - I kept looking through the windows at the islands we were flying over, beautiful! Both flights were under 50 minutes long, we even got a small bottle of water, coffee, a cookie and a wet towel. I can totally recommend Ellinair.",yes
Elinair,2/10,"  Heraklion to Athens. We bought the online ticket because it included hold baggage in the price and appeared to be the most reasonable. We checked in very easily as there was no one at the checkin desk. We had our bags tagged and sent on the conveyor belt at 10am. Alls good. We had a quick flight to Athens all on time. Within 15 minutes of arriving at Athens we were able to pick up our bags off the carousel. Took them to the taxi. Less than an hour later we checked in our Athens Plaka Hotel. My husband went to open his bag and to his dismay he found the toggle openers of his Osprey pack had 5 out of the 6 missing off his zips making it virtually impossible to open. I immediately emailed Ellinair, they responded and said a complaints department would contact us. They did but because we hadn’t notified the people at the airport they couldn’t do anything about it. Well, we didn’t notice the missing handles at that point. Anyway, since then we have realised that the bag had been opened and new gloves had been stolen.  For this reason we wouldn’t go near Ellinair or Heraklion Airport ever again. The most reasonable ticket has ended up costing us a lot more than we bargained for. We are incensed that there are staff who are dishonest and clearly not enough checks are done when employing people. There should be cctv in place in the baggage handling area so they can be checked as I’m sure we are not the first or the last to have items stolen during baggage handling.",no
Elinair,10/10,"  Thessaloniki to Athens. Very nice and comfortable journey. Flight was almost full. Used the website to check-in and a mobile phone boarding pass was sent, making it really easy. Crew was friendly and helpful. Candy, small snack and drink offered in this 40' domestic Greek flight. Luggage was included in the price and although I did not have any, it made the cabin have much more space for people's hand-luggage. Timely and orderly departure and arrival. Very good experience - I  recommend them on this route.",yes
Elinair,9/10,"  Moscow to Thessaloniki. I usually use this company in my trips to Moscow. Even if i was wondering about this new company that they use leasing airplanes, i tried it and i want to say just one thing. these are our lovely Greeks. Every trip is small party, specially when the destination is a Greek airport. People are drinking free alcohol (Greek wine), they are eating, and are enjoying their trip. Staff is very good.They use more than 3 languages.",yes
Elinair,10/10,"  Very pleasant flight from Athens to Thessaloniki with Ellinair. Easy process of booking and e-check in, the boarding pass is sent to the mobile, so no app or printer is needed. Athens Airport was a breeze, the fee included checked baggage, so I chose to check in my hand luggage also (for free - the company did it with a smile). Departure and arrival on time, flight about 60% full. Good legspace, service included very small snack and drinks. Immaculate and smiling crew. Quick retrieval of baggage in Thessaloniki. Excellent experience!",yes
Elinair,6/10," Both flights I took from Thessaloniki to Athens return had a delay. The aircraft was tiny and the air condition was blowing warm air. It really felt like a bus. The cabin crew was professional, kind and tried to counterbalance this mess. The ticket was a bit cheaper relative to other companies but very expensive considering the level and the quality of service provided.",no
Elinair,10/10,"  Thessaloniki to Athens. I was pleasantly surprised by the service on this short flight (approx. 40min). Service was quick, good selection of drinks and small candies and biscuits. Friendly staff, aircraft was clean. The crew are ready to assist the passengers. I will be happy to fly them again.",yes
Elinair,3/10,  Flew Ellinair from Thessaloniki to Cologne. Booking process and space on the plane were unacceptable. Staff were friendly. Propably the only aspect which could be reviewed as good. The airline is not following European standards and is charging extreme prices for this poor service.,no
Elinair,9/10,"We decided to fly from Santorini to Heraklion rather than take the fast ferry as there wasn't much difference in price and it was more convenient to arrive at Heraklion airport. We hadn't heard of Ellinair and there weren't many reviews. We were a little apprehensive but we were pleasantly surprised. The flight was on-time, the aircraft clean and comfortable and the crew were friendly and professional.",yes
Elinair,9/10,"  I flew Ellinair from Thessaloniki to Verona. The flight had 30 minutes delay, otherwise everything went really fine. A nice meal on board and the baggage (incl 20kg) were included for a really cheap price. The aircraft, a Boeing b737 was a bit old but the seats were really comfortable.
",yes
Elinair,8/10,"  Ellinair from Heraklion to Thessaloniki. Boarding began with 10min delay. Departure was also delayed, but due to a problem with the ground power generator. Otherwise the flight was OK and the crew very helpful and friendly. I missed the cheap fares, but the price was fair enough. All in all a very good alternative to other, more popular greek carriers.",yes
Elinair,9/10,"Great regional airline. Even though an old aircraft, it was very well kept and clean. The service was great for 1 hour flight, caramel, and juice. The staff was very professional, friendly and very thorough with safety regulations.",yes
Elinair,9/10,"First flight with this new Greek airline, Ellinair. Was not sure what to expect but this 35 minute flight was one of the best short flights I have flown. For such a short flight, the flight attendants managed a professional and efficient cabin service as well.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  We have been trying to get our tickets refunded since June, always told to call back or wait for a call. Now we’re told no refunds, only credit. Ok, but guess what? Same story! Wait for us to call you or call back in a week. Never ever hear from them and literally no progress. Anyone else in this situation? We can’t be the only ones.",no
Sky Express Airlines,10/10,  A very pleasant experience. Efficient from boarding to luggage delivery. Welcoming ground and in-flight staff. The flight was on time and a good value. Within Greece distances aren't that long but the alternative would have been train-bus-ferry-bus and one day less vacation. So air hopping is a great alternative and sends your right where you want to be. Will definitely fly with them again.,yes
Sky Express Airlines,1/10," Terrible punctuality, both to and from Athens-Santorini flights were late by 1.5hr. Hurts when those are late night flights and you arrive at the hotel at around midnight due to the delay. Ground staff were clueless on both occasions. No apologies from the inflight staff. At EUR300, it wasn’t worth it at all. Aircraft are noisy. Luckily I was carrying a small rucksack, as those with standard cabin trollies struggled to fit those in overhead compartment. There is barely any role of inflight staff during those short flights.",no
Sky Express Airlines,10/10," Heraklion to Athens with Sky Express Airlines. I was a bit worried reading other reviews, but my flight was on time, they give you access to lounge for free, they give snack on the plane, honestly it had been a long time since I had airline treatment like that. I was impressed and loved this airline.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  Naxos to Athens. Would not recommend. Managed to break all 3 of our suitcases, 2 of which were brand new. The lock on my case was broken off and it was evident someone had tried to go through it for valuables- luckily there weren’t any in the bag. When I tried to speak to staff about this they shrugged at me and walked away.",no
Sky Express Airlines,2/10,"  Athens to Santorini. Terrible airline, disorganized check in took an hour, not advised that baggage had to be 15kg - we were 2-3kg over and charged  56 Euros. I have checked their website which says 5 euro per kg not 8 Euro. Sat on the tarmac for 1 hr in the heat, just as hot for the trip, poor aircon on the plane.",no
Sky Express Airlines,2/10,"  Athens to Naxos. Absolutely hopeless checkin process. It is out sourced to 3rd party who do 10+ other airlines. Result is hundreds of passengers trying to get thru 4 desks. If you are Greek & shout & push your way to the front you catch your flight maybe. Everyone else is left in the queue. Miss your flight, go buy another ticket for the next flight! Avoid this scam!",no
Sky Express Airlines,3/10,"  Heraklion to Rhodes. Keep Away. Announced for 6:30 boarding time and finally we got a delay announce that due to ""operational reasons"" we will have a delay in further news after about an hour. When we first travelled to Kreta with this airline, our chairs were dirty.",no
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  Kefalonia to Corfu. Absolutely terrible experience. The flight was delayed 2 hours, no information was given at all, the information boards were not updated, none of the flight tracker websites were updated with the delay. We had to just sit in the airport, hoping the flight wasn't cancelled. Such a joke. When the plane did arrive no explanation or apology was given. Worst customer service ever. The Greek aviation industry has ruined my impression of Greece.",no
Sky Express Airlines,7/10,"  Athens to Paros. We were a little worried catching this flight, after reading the reviews. We had a little issue with our carry on mini suitcase being too big and we ended up paying 45eu extra. I do warn you, square carry on bags will not fit in the over head lockers so best to organise them to get checked in before you reach the counter. Other than that, the bags arrived at the destination with no issues and the flight it self was on time and we didn’t have any issues boarding or during the flight. I would recommend.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,8/10,"  Athens to Kefalonia. Flight was a little late but the service was good for a budget airline, we purchased extra baggage which was a good price which came with the added bonus of a lounge pass at Athens airport a free drink and biscuit was also supplied during the one hour flight",yes
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  Customer service was appalling at Athens Airport on arrival. Bags were not put on the airline in Naxos and no communication about this until we investigated further on arrival into Athens. Only told that it was a last minute decision and that they would be coming by ferry. Customer service woman at the counter seemed to think by us as the customer asking a question it was a personal attack on her. Given that she is the representative of the airline my request was only for her to explain what happened and the solution. She provided none, was rude and said that Sky Express accept no liability for the missing luggage. Aircraft was also late to depart and again staff seemed to be very good and “knowing nothing” and remaining vague.",no
Sky Express Airlines,2/10, Cyprus to Chania via Athens. Very bad customer service. The staff seemed very frustrated when I asked what's going on with the flight and never got back to me. I had to learn what's going on from other customers. That will be the first and last time. If they don't like working here it's not customers fault. They're supposed to be there to help.,no
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  Athens to Mykonos. Our flight was delayed for 5 hours before we were able to board only to try to take off on a plane that the pilot had to land back down.  They promised us a flight to Mykonos from Athens that night so we waited for seven hours before they decided to cancel the flight at 1am in the morning. They did not provide hotel accommodation nor compensation for the hotel we booked at Mykonos that we cannot get a refund on. We had to sleep in the airport waiting for the next flight at 5am to make to Mykonos to catch our flight back home. We booked with another airline because they didn’t have any flights til much later the next day. They promised us hotel, compensation for our loss n time but it was all lies. I emailed the company several times with the info they told us to contact them for the compensation and have not heard one single word back. ",no
Sky Express Airlines,1/10," Naxos to Athens with Sky Express Airlines. The worst airline I have ever flown! We have just arrived in Athens to be told the captain chose to not take any checked baggage at all on the flight! Yes - not one suitcase was carried apparently due to the aircraft being over weight. They off loaded 2 passengers (voluntarily) and then don't tell you your bags are not going to make it on the flight - you find that out when you arrive in Athens! So we have a connecting flight to Austria - but they will only send the bags to Vienna - not Salzburg which is our final destination. We think they will arrive - by ferry around 8pm tonight! So, we have to stay in Athens - at our cost - change flights for tomorrow. Apparently - this happens daily, totally unacceptable in 2019. Get bigger aircraft's that can handle passengers luggage requirements.",no
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  Do yourself a favor and do not book with this airline. Ever. I’ve been in Greece for 1 week and this airline has single handedly almost ruined my entire holiday. I am sitting at the airport an hour after my flight landed after a several hour delay with no bags in sight. It is also the middle of the night. I can’t even begin to express my disgust for this airline but if you would like a relaxing and peaceful holiday, do not book with them.",no
Sky Express Airlines,5/10,  I flew with them twice on our trip to Greece. Once from Rhodes to Crete they cancelled my families flight (4) and rebooked it for 3 hours later. My son booked this flight and when we called to complain they said had sent an email 2 weeks before. No email was sent. My husband and I had also already booked them from Santorini to Athens and they did the same thing. They cancelled our flight never informed us. I checked this time that's the only way I knew our flight time was changed until later since this time I didn't trust them. We called them and all they said was they sent the email. Both times they lied and were very unapologetic.,no
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  
Flew Athens to Mykonos with Sky Express Airlines. Delayed flight 3 times. Our flight was scheduled for 11:20 am. We were informed that the flight was delayed at 10:30 am to 12:40 pm. At 12:40 pm we were informed that the flight was delayed to 13:45 pm. We began to board on a bus at 13:30 pm. As we were boarding a bus they stopped letting people in. We waited one more hour standing on the bus. When we were taken to the plane we waited more than one and half hours. Awful airline. Never using it again!",no
Sky Express Airlines,10/10,  Naxos to Athens. Loved the ease that our luggage was checked weighed and checked in without any hassles. It is a small airport but the staff knew what they were doing as well as assisting passengers who were not sure of what to do. A very big thank you and I will definitely flying with you again next summer.,yes
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,  Athens to Kefalonia. This airline was contacted when it was explained to them that a mistake had been made on the ticket. It was not a change of mind situations. They charged €35 for a changed of mind fee. An email was sent 3 times of explaining that it was not a change of mind and the money should be refunded. There was no reply from any of the 3 emails. This is so wrong and a disgraced of the behaviour by avoiding the true issue of not refunding the money.,no
Sky Express Airlines,1/10," Naxos Island to Athens. Delayed (as usual) for about one hour without any notification or information provided by the ground staff. No apology on board. Distant and unfriendly flight attendant. Old equipment with dilapidated interior. No web check-in available. Very bad experience in general. Neither a professional service nor a reliable airline, with not necessarily reasonable tariffs.",no
Sky Express Airlines,8/10,"  Siteia to Alexandroupoulis. Small propeller planes with lot of noise during the flight. The planes seem old and some seats can be in bad condition. The staff is polite, they offer a drink, cookie, caramel and a towel during the flight. Usually on time, better value for money than other regional airlines.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,10/10,"  Flew Athens to Chios. Much cheaper than Olympic Airways and you have access to SkyServ Lounge at Athens Airport, also free 13 kg Luggage and 3 kg handbag. There is not much food selection at the lounge but is good to be away from the crowds. Both flights on ATR42 and were on time. Crew were great and friendly. They offer coffee and a small cookie on a 50 minute flight. They do not have inflight magazines but they offer FreePress magazine.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,9/10," I flew round trip from Athens to Kalymnos with Sky Express Airlines. I was totally satisfied with the flights. Only around 10 minutes delay for both flights. Check in luggage was included in the fare. Also at Athens airport after the check in, I was offered a free coffee / refreshment at the lounge bar and I was allowed to use the fast lane for the security check.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,1/10,"  Santorini to Athens. My mom and I had a flight booked for 3:15pm. We had a second flight leaving Athens at 6:45pm. The Sky Express flight was delayed more than 4 hours in Santorni because of the day befores wind storm. They did not tell us in enough time to get to Athens via ferry or another airline. They barely gave any information. There were tons of other flights going out and my mom and I could have booked another but they kept saying we were leaving. Then by the time we left, with no food, my mom boarded with some chips. The flight attendant said she had to put them away and she said she hadn't eaten in more than four hours. The flight attendant snapped back and said she hadn't eaten in 5 hours. She was extremely rude to my mom and this was on Mothers Day. We missed out flight in Athens and had to pay for a whole new flight. No help was given and no money back. Our new flight was leaving the next day so we had to pay for an overnight in a hotel, the taxi there and back to the airport and we didn't get our money back from the hotel in Bucharest. This airline cost us over $500. And no apology was given.  We will never use it again!",no
Sky Express Airlines,9/10,"My friend and I flew round trip from Athens to Zakynthos, Greece with Sky Express Airlines. I was a bit apprehensive because I get nervous when taking smaller planes (also a propeller plane). Needless to say I had nothing to worry about. These two flights ended up being the most smooth of all our 6 flights in 12 days. There is only one flight attendant on board but both ways they were very friendly! They even give you candy, cookies and beverages, despite the fact that the flights were in total 40 mins take off to landing. I would recommend this airline for any travel within Greece itself. Our first flight was delayed about 30 minutes, but considering the flight time was estimated at 1 hour and ended up only being 40 mins, it didn't make much difference in the end. They also included a free 15kg checked bag at no extra charge, which is more then any other budget airline. Gooder value for you money.",yes
Sky Express Airlines,7/10,Limnos-Lesvos on a BAe Jetstream. A quick and friendly check-in. No seats were allocated for this short flight. We were bussed the 50 metres to the plane which took about a minute across an empty tarmac. The seats were comfortable enough given the length of the flight though the aircraft interior looked quite worn. The single crew member served a boiled sweet and a cold drink. The flight operated on schedule.,yes
